But there has long been debate about why those inclinations have remained so strong.", "A common explanation has been the notion of \"linked fate\" — the belief among black folks that their individual prospects are tied to a collective well-being. But White said that belief can't really explain how the powerful norm for black people to cast votes for Democrats has maintained itself over the past 50 years; norms, after all, have to be policed.", "What White and and three other researchers ", " is that social pressure from other black people is how this Democratic norm gets policed. They found that the expectations around this norm were so powerful that simply having a black questioner ask a black respondent about their voting preferences made that respondent more likely to say they were voting for a Democratic candidate.", ", one of the study's authors, said this is how everyone votes. We like to think of our voting choices as purely rational, but we take cues from the people around us, especially when we don't know much about a candidate or an issue.

But entrenched segregation today keeps black people of different ideological stripes in close social and spatial proximity to one another. It's easier to enforce collective norms, to feel affirmation or sanction from black folks, when you have black neighbors, go to black schools and mosques and churches and hair salons, when you carry around around that social history and that sense of shared stakes. Black people are surrounded by black Democrats, so they vote like black Democrats.", "And when they don't, they get checked. Laird pointed to an example of this from the Kanye mess: John Legend, Kanye's friend and sometimes collaborator, sent him a text message nudging him to reconsider — or just consider at all — what he was saying.

It's certainly not hard to find them: the capitalists who think supporting black banks can offset the effects of racism on black wealth; the social conservatives who see absent fathers as exacerbating black marginalization.

If the old saw goes that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged, then a black conservative is a conservative who has been assumed to be the mugger.", "To put this another way: Those black conservatives differ from mainstream conservatism because they aren't organized around white interests. Black conservatives get black people whereas white conservatives who applaud Kanye for \"escaping the Democrat plantation\" are so removed from black folks that they think it makes sense to invoke the language of slavery to describe the overwhelming majority of black voters.", "Whiteness, demographically and ideologically, has been so central to the mainstream conservative project that bringing black conservatives into the fold and into the Republican Party — which derives almost all of its electoral support from white conservatives — wouldn't just change its racial demographics.

She said Tom Carrico told her the company was trying to clear FDA hurdles in order to use the Bridge for opioid addiction, and she agreed to do \"some testing with the Bridge for him and for the company.\"", "Taca himself provided much of the data for the research from his clinic, and appeared to be recruiting participants.

The plan then was for patients to come back after five days for a final evaluation and possible Vivitrol treatment. But without monitoring and support, the time spent at home led many patients to drop out of treatment. \"There was a fair amount of people that didn't show up,\" Lock said of her patients who were assessed for the Bridge. \"And then there was a few people that didn't show back up to get them taken off.\"", "Paul Finch, a physician assistant in Fairbanks, Alaska, who gathered data for the study, said he has now used the device dozens of times. He estimated that a little more than half of his Bridge patients successfully complete the detox. \"Two-thirds of those will go on to get Vivitrol shots,\" he said. \"None of it's perfect.\"", "In a clinical trial, researchers would normally report how many people completed a study and how many dropped out so it's possible to better gauge how successful a treatment is. The published study says 73 people were included in the study. Sixty-four people went on to take Vivitrol or naltrexone; the other nine didn't.

Another did not.", "Autumn Howard, a 30-year-old patient who used the Bridge in Mathews' program in April 2016, said staff told her the device was experimental, but she couldn't remember being told she was part of a study because her withdrawals were too intense.", "\"It was kind of a blur,\" Howard said. \"I couldn't read ... I don't even know pretty much a lot of what they said to me when I got there.\"", "James, the patient at the Union County clinic, also said he didn't know he was part of a study when he got the Bridge in December.

Side Effects and NPR obtained a copy of the form, which does not mention a study, or even withdrawals.", "The day after he got the Bridge, James shared a photo of himself with the device still behind his ear.

What would happen if, as with AI, the new life forms we create get out of our control and become more efficient in the game of life than we are?

Over a meal in a tony French restaurant — a delicate tuna tartare accompanied by a dry Chablis with apricot undertones — he talks about his journey.

Its directive asserts that people have a right to privacy, even on the Internet, and that search engines like Google must determine whether an individual's privacy right outweighs the public's right to know even correct information. And so, the \"right to be forgotten\" law for the Internet was born.", "Buried near the midpoint of the ", " was the legal ammunition that Shefet needed. The judges suggested there is an \"inextricable link\" between Google's Mountain View headquarters and any of its subsidiaries around the world.

The right one is: \"Can they? That's a legal question.\"", "Fleischer doesn't want Americans to be seduced by the European option. He offers two arguments to make his point.", "First, the U.S. — more so than any other country on earth — values free speech. So much so that it's a First Amendment right. What Europe is doing, he says, \"would be inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution.\"", "And second, Europe's new laws are creating an Internet that people can exploit to hide the truth, Fleischer says. As examples, he cites people with criminal records who want to bury accurate news reports; lawyers and dentists who want to hide the complaints of unhappy customers; business owners obsessed with projecting a certain image.", "\"I think a lot of people would think that's troubling — to think that the more wealthy and powerful in the world can use this tool to polish up their online reputations far more than the average Joe,\" Fleischer says.", "He downplays Shefet and says he is familiar with his work, from reading about him in the press.", "Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., Charles Tobin, a prominent media lawyer, says he is very familiar with Shefet and fears his message cuts against a transparency society. \"I do not agree with hardly anything he says. Can you imagine O.J. going to court after his acquittal, or President Clinton after impeachment — trying to scrub the record?\" However, he has invited Shefet to speak at an American Bar Association session in Paris about speech and privacy.", "Google declined to say how many requests the company receives or honors from Americans seeking to remove a search result.", "One New York man tried. But to no avail.", "He asked not to be named for fear of further damaging his reputation, having lost his career after his name was cited in a news story about a Wall Street investment firm that was misleading investors. He has since asked for and received letters from both the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission confirming his innocence and he has shared them with Google. But despite these affirmations, which he showed NPR, Google would not remove the article from search results. It has been eight years and he still can't get a job. He and his wife want children, but his entire life is on hold.", "He mailed a letter to the home of Google CEO Sundar Pichai pleading his case: \"Please put yourself in my shoes, and ask how would you feel if your career and entire life's work and savings all were destroyed ... would you not morally and legitimately expect Google to do the right thing ... ?\"", "Pichai did not respond. One of the Google chief's lawyers, Lee-Anne Mulholland, did write to the New York man in an email: \"[W]hile", "we are very sympathetic to your story, we are unable to remove [the] article.\"", "Google declined to comment further on the case.", "\"Google is not unable,\" says Shefet, who bristles at that notion. \"They are unwilling. Why do they pretend it's about free speech? There's no principle involved.\"", "But Shefet does not want the tech titans to see him as the enemy. Though he has made his mark in the opposition, he says he wouldn't mind being a peacemaker, a broker between Silicon Valley and people who feel they've been harmed by the sludge on the Internet.", "\"He's having so much more fun,\" says Tom Hoyem, Shefet's high school teacher, who explains that Shefet wasn't always as jovial all those years ago. In fact, he was a very serious child, perhaps because he came from a broken home, Hoyem posits: \"Dan was too old when he was 16.\"", "Dining at a small Paris pub, Shefet talks about how his family shapes his worldview. When Shefet was a young boy, his parents split up. It was at a time when almost no one divorced. \"They hated each other — or, I should say, my mom hated my dad,\" he recalls. \"I wasn't allowed to see him.\"", "For many years they had no contact, which made Shefet sad because, he says, his father was a vast ocean of knowledge, a repository of obscure facts and insightful answers.", "Fast-forward 15 years and not only did the animosity fade but, in a surprise twist, Shefet's parents remarried.", "The lesson is not simply that there's a thin line between love and hate; but, as Shefet puts it, \"Everyone is always right. No one fights for their side when they believe they're wrong. So, if you can see how your adversaries believe they're right, then you can come to an understanding.\"", "He hopes it takes the titans and their disaffected users less time than it took his mom and dad."]},
