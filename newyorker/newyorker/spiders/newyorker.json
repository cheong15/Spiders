Will voters be swayed?"], "newsContext": ["Last ", "Thursday, at a restaurant in Bluefield, West Virginia, called Macado’s (rhymes with “wackadoos”), Don Blankenship, the convicted criminal, former coal executive, and current Republican Senate candidate, held a town-hall meeting for his supporters. At one point in the evening, a retired miner named Delbert Bailey stood up to speak. Eight years earlier, he had taken time off from work at the Upper Big Branch mine to go fishing, narrowly avoiding a gas explosion that killed twenty-nine members of his crew. At the time, Blankenship was the multimillionaire C.E.O. of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine. After the disaster, a federal jury ", " of a misdemeanor count of “conspiring to willfully commit mine-safety violations,” and sentenced him to a year in prison. (One of the tables at Macado’s held copies of “", ",” the pamphlet that Blankenship wrote in his cell, alongside trays of sliced meat and cheese.) Most of the victims’ families blamed Blankenship for the tragedy, Bailey said, but he didn’t. “Everybody had a little part to play in it,” he said—the mine’s managing foremen, federal inspectors, and Massey executives. “Everybody knew something about what was going on.” Blankenship, standing next to him, looked uncomfortable.", "Blankenship was released from the Taft Correctional Institution, in California, last May and announced his senatorial bid six months later. Since then, he has spent more than a million dollars of his own money on the campaign, flooding West Virginia’s airwaves with pledges to bring back jobs, curtail abortion rights, fight the opioid epidemic, and build a border wall. (West Virginia has one of the smallest immigrant populations in the country.) Blankenship has consistently portrayed himself as a Washington outsider and a Trumpian warrior for the common man. As he said at the town hall, governing “is not a matter of mental capacity; it’s a matter of political courage.” Now, to virtually everyone’s surprise, he appears to have a chance of winning the G.O.P. nomination and facing the Democratic incumbent, Senator Joe Manchin, in November. The ", " show him tied with or edging out his two main rivals, Representative Evan Jenkins and the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey.", "The Republican leadership in D.C., fearful that it could have another ", " on its hands (Moore recently lost a special Senate election in Alabama, following allegations of sexual misconduct), has vigorously opposed Blankenship’s candidacy, particularly in the past few weeks. Shortly before the event at Macado’s, the President’s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., ", ", “I’m gonna go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship! No more fumbles like Alabama.” (“My son says a lot of things I wish he didn’t say, too,” Blankenship told me.) Last week, the candidate struck back against the political establishment in a pair of ads, ", " referred to ", ", the Senate Majority Leader, as a “swamp captain” with a “China family.” (McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, Trump’s Secretary of Transportation, was born in Taiwan.) “He attacked me and called me despicable and mentally ill,” Blankenship said. “He started it.” Later, ", ", Blankenship said, “I will represent West Virginia people, not China people. I am an America person, and I will put America first.” On Monday, President Trump echoed his son, urging West Virginians to vote for Jenkins or Morrisey.", "The morning after the town hall, Bailey took me on a tour of a defunct coal mine in Beckley, his home town. He had recently spent a few months there as a guide, regaling tourists with stories about local history and his father and grandfather, who were also miners. When we met up, Bailey told me that his wife was angry with him about his comments at Macado’s. “She said, ‘You was on TV!’ She said, ‘We’re gonna get repercussions.’ ” In their community, Bailey explained, supporting Blankenship is a no-no. He had first found that out during the Upper Big Branch trial, in 2014, when he had stopped in to watch the proceedings one day, joining the deceased miners’ families in the gallery. “There wasn’t nothing there but hate,” he said. Afterward, Bailey approached Blankenship and shook his hand. “He didn’t mean for none of that to happen, and I wanted to let him know that I stood behind him,” Bailey told me. “But I took a tongue lashing in the elevator. Someone said to me, ‘I hope you get run over by a train.’ ”", "Bailey and I fell in with a group of elementary-school kids and boarded a rail cart that ran through the mine. Partway through the ride, our conductor, Marwin, shut off the electricity. It was so dark that I couldn’t see my hand when I held it an inch from my face. Later, Marwin began demonstrating various tools, and Bailey called out that he had forgotten to mention the one that monitors methane-gas levels. Bailey launched into a technical description that soon had me—and, I imagine, the children—lost. Perhaps that’s why Marwin had skipped it. But Bailey’s job at Upper Big Branch had been monitoring methane levels; even if it was only a demonstration for eight-year-olds, he wasn’t going to let it go. We emerged back into the sunshine as another school group passed by. “That was so cool!” one of the kids yelled.", "Later that afternoon, I", " drove to the town of Glen Daniel, not far from the Upper Big Branch mine, which is now sealed. Sherwood Brown, the manager of Davis Auto Parts, a local hangout, was holding court behind the counter. A self-described tree-hugger, Brown said that he was “the exception here.” He has a windmill at his house, voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and holds five black belts in martial arts. As the only African-American student in his school when he was growing up, he said, “I decided to start learning karate when I was six.” Like many people in the community, he knows people who died in the 2010 tragedy. “I lost a couple buddies down in U.B.B.,” Brown said. “One of them taught in one of my karate schools, and one of them was a student.” As for Blankenship, he added, “Most of the guys I talk to really don’t support him very much. They don’t trust him.”", "A giant of a man named Mike Cline, a regular at the shop, was sitting at a counter stool. He used to be a miner but now owns what he called “a working man’s golf course” nearby. It has no dress code, and used to attract miners on their way home from work. These days, though, there are so few left that barely anyone comes by. Cline was ambivalent about Blankenship. “You can’t blame him for everything,” he said. “He probably didn’t know any more about what was going on in that mine than me or you. He had bosses.” Another man who stopped in said that he had quit working at Upper Big Branch not long before the explosion. He said that it was mostly the foremen’s fault, then shook his head and would not say any more, afraid that it would get back to Blankenship’s network.", "After the town hall ended, Blankenship left Macado’s alone. I had more questions and said I’d follow him out. “In another situation, that wouldn’t be a bad thing,” he said, holding the door for me. “But I don’t think that’s what you had in mind.” We stepped into the parking lot. “You’re not allowed to see my car,” he said. “It’s got Nevada plates.” (Blankenship’s opponents have criticized him for spending most of his time at his home in Las Vegas, where his fiancée lives.) As he looked for his keys, he began telling me about how he used to travel around the country with his son, who competes professionally in rally-car races. “I can’t drive across state lines,” he said. “Until Wednesday!” The day after the primary, his year-long probation will end.", "Suddenly, Blankenship turned to me and said, “Are you a bad person?” I try not to be, I replied. “Well, most reporters are bad people,” he said. “But maybe they don’t know it.” We exchanged business cards. He told me to hold on to his for when he’s President. “If Trump gets in my way, I’ll just run against him,” he said."]},

On Monday, a bomb went off in downtown Kabul, killing four passersby. A dozen members of the Kabul press corps rushed over to document the bloodshed that had become a routine part of their job. Forty minutes later, a second attacker, carrying a camera to blend in, detonated explosives that killed twenty-five people, including nine journalists, and wounded forty-five others, making Monday the deadliest day for Afghan media since the U.S.-led war in ", " began, in 2001. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.", "Among the dead was Shah Marai, of Agence France-Presse. Marai began driving cars for AFP twenty-two years ago, and worked his way up to being the agency’s chief photographer in the country. Over the last two decades, Marai took over eighteen thousand pictures, images that helped shape how America and the West see, and perceive, Afghanistan.", "I met Marai at the wake of a common friend, Ahmad Sardar, a journalist who was killed with his family during the Serena Hotel attack, in 2014. (That is another strange thing about these spectacular attacks—how myself and others used them to mark the passing of time.) Marai had taken to organizing the funeral and the rest in the aftermath of Sardar’s death, a duty I remember him performing with passion and grace.", "Last night, I spoke to another mutual friend of ours, who had introduced me to Marai at the wake all those years ago, the former New York ", " reporter Habib Zahori. In recent years, Zahori and many other Afghan journalists have left Afghanistan for North America and Europe, where they cash in dignity and status at home for safety and menial labor abroad. They drive Ubers and work as security guards now, because “in Afghanistan knowing how to use a computer and speaking English were skills. Here a kid can use a computer. Everyone speaks English.” Zahori, like Marai and scores of other Afghan journalists, were autodidacts who took great pride in their trade, which they understood as bearing witness. The growth of the Afghan media was among the few success stories of the country’s post-9/11 years; it was free, it was independent, and it set a new standard in a region—Pakistan, Iran, the Gulf—that ranked poorly on press-freedom indexes.", "Habib and his friends in the Afghan diaspora often spoke about returning to Afghanistan and to their old lives once they got their papers, but, after Monday, it wasn’t clear if anyone could still be committed to this now seemingly deadly plan. It was  jarring, as we spoke, to measure the distance between the living and the dead, and to realize that the distance was much shorter than we cared to admit. “When a tragedy happens, it’s not only the loss of a friend that hits you. It is also something else. You think about your own death,” Zahori told me. “That’s what we’d do, you remember, whenever there was a bombing, we would rush off. That could have been any of us.”", "That math is what had eventually persuaded me to leave Afghanistan, in 2017. When I returned to Kabul, this past winter, I was struck by how much more violent the city had become. Things I used to do without ceremony—going shopping at the nearby market, taking local taxis, exchanging pleasantries with neighbors on the street where we lived—now seemed like impossibly foolish acts.", "I was struck even more by how increasingly challenging it is to measure and report on that very distance, between violent death and a life in which you're constantly looking over your shoulder, in a country that is slipping further and further into disorder. The Afghan government, meanwhile, refuses to admit that it is unravelling. It needs to sell the story of success in order for it to continue to receive foreign funding, and this makes it famously unreliable when it comes to basic facts, such as who had died, by what means, in which attack—the bloody accounting that makes up so much of conflict reporting.", "There is great need for that accounting now, as the past winter has been a season of carnage in Kabul. On January 22nd, six gunmen besieged the Intercontinental Hotel, killing twenty-two people, according to the unreliable government count, or forty-three, according to unofficial and unverifiable local media estimates. Among those killed in the thirteen hour shootout were four Americans, including a public-relations spokesman for the former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. The ", " claimed responsibility for the attack. Two days later, a Save the Children office in Jalalabad, ninety-five miles east of Kabul, was stormed. In a pattern that has become depressingly familiar, suicide bombers affiliated with the Islamic State drove a car bomb into the compound gates, killing up to six people and injuring dozens more. Three days after that, on January 27th, a Taliban insurgent drove an ambulance through a cordoned-off road in downtown Kabul, and detonated a bomb, killing a hundred and three. The following day, a military academy was attacked by Islamic State militants with rocket-propelled grenades. Eleven Afghan soldiers were killed. A total of a hundred and ninety-seven men, women, and children—Afghans and Americans, Hazaras and Pashtuns, commercial pilots, soldiers, and pedestrians— were killed or injured in a single week. After a lull, on March 21st, the", " first day of the year in the Persian calendar, a suicide bomber detonated near a shrine where families had gathered to mark the coming of spring. The blast killed twenty-nine people and injured fifty-two. Then, on April 23rd, another major attack killed fifty-seven Afghans lining up to register to vote.", "Most Afghans blamed the bloodshed on their government, its Western sponsors, and their collective incompetence, on a scale that they saw as a kind of complicity. An Afghan coffin-maker who gave his name as Saeed said that the animus he felt for his governing élites is such that, if they all died tomorrow, he would not cry for them. “May Allah destroy all of them,” he told me this past February, when I visited his shop in north Kabul.", "“I campaigned for him,” Saeed said, referring to the Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. “Now he is supporting the foreigners.” Saeed, who is forty-three, spoke to me through an interpreter for nearly an hour, but spent most of that time laying out why he did not wish to speak to me, a foreign reporter and a woman. “All foreigners are the same. They came here to destroy and they do not give profit to us.” Saeed had been sitting outside when we had come by. His dilapidated space heater and stainless-steel flask were the only sources of heat against the still harsh February cold. He used to make coffins with wood from eastern Afghanistan, Saeed explained, but, after a logging ban in 2006, he, like others, began using timber imported from China. The cheap shine of laminated wood stood bright against the dust-colored storefront as we spoke.", "The ambulance bombing is what had brought me to Saeed. In lieu of official statistics, reporters look for alternative measures of violence, and the number of coffins sold seemed like an indicator as good as any. Twelve years ago, when Saeed first opened up shop, there were just two other coffin-makers on his row, he told me. Now the street is lined with scores of shops selling coffins, among the few growth industries in the country. Saeed had a contract with a government hospital, as did others on his street.", "Saeed hadn’t always felt so strongly against the Americans, he told me, but he had since had time to consider the fact of the war, which anyone could see had not been going so well for a while now. The only good thing America could do now is leave, he said.", "The security situation in the Afghan capital has been worsening for years, but the particular violence of the winter months penetrated the minds of the city’s expats  because the sites of carnage were familiar to them. Many had spent afternoons on the tennis court at the Intercontinental and had attended parties hosted by the European Union or the Nordic embassies located on the road the ambulance had driven on.", "Some expats argued to me that the violence last winter did not exceed previous levels, but the attacks’ proximity to one another fuelled a new feeling of terror. The spectacular and bloody attacks sent a message to the Afghan public: the U.S.-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani could not protect them, and that task now fell to the people themselves. Afghans mourned for the past, when bloodshed was largely limited to the fighting season, which usually meant the summer months. Now fighting bled into the pomegranate season, then the citrus season, and never really seemed to end.", "After promising to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, President Donald Trump deployed a few thousand additional troops,, expanded  air strikes, and dismissed peace talks. Analysts told me that Trump’s contradictory approach—a token troop increase combined with a refusal to negotiate —will result in the war grinding on. Ordinary Afghans continue to suffer. Ten thousand four hundred and fifty three Afghans were killed in 2017, according to ", " an already conservative estimate. Sixty-five percent of them were killed in attacks by the Taliban, Islamic State affiliates, or other anti-government forces. The U.N. also reported that civilian casualties from U.S. and Afghan government air strikes went up seven per cent in 2017, with two hundred and ninety-five civilians killed.", "During our phone call, Habib recalled a local version of a funereal refrain. “God takes away good people from us because he likes them too much, and he doesn’t want them to stay for a long time and commit sin,” he told me. “I didn’t believe it when I heard it, but I am starting to believe that now.”"]},

There, she managed a team that did hiring for the firm, and later she helped oversee the firm’s pool of research analysts. “I was really attracted to it because it was a place of real integrity, meritocracy, transparency, accountability,” Bonner told me recently. “All the things that I had been seeking culturally. It felt very refreshing.”", "The money wasn’t bad, either. After three years at Bridgewater, she left to work at a series of startups. Then, in 2016, a headhunter contacted her about the possibility of taking a position at a company called Point72 Asset Management. Point72 wasn’t the average investment company; it was started by the stock trader Steven A. Cohen, who had achieved ", " infamy as the founder of ", ". S.A.C. was shut down, in 2013, after a nearly decade-long government investigation into insider trading at the firm. Eight former S.A.C. employees were convicted or pleaded guilty to criminal charges as a result of the investigation, and, though Cohen himself was never charged, S.A.C. was indicted. The firm eventually paid the government $1.8 billion to settle the case. (Charges against two of the former employees were dismissed as a result of an appeals-court ruling.) As part of the settlement, Cohen was barred from managing other people’s money until January, 2018.", "The rise and fall of Cohen’s hedge fund was, on a basic level, a tale of men behaving badly. The story, which I recounted in my book about the case, “", ",” had barely any female characters on either the hedge-fund side or the government side. Earlier this year, a former hedge-fund manager named Dominique Mielle ", " in an article for Business Insider, arguing that the financial industry was hurting its own profits by refusing to be more inclusive toward women and other underrepresented groups. Herd behavior, Mielle wrote, leads to bad decision-making. Around the same time, Bonner was taking steps to illustrate Mielle’s point: on February 12th, ", " in federal court against Cohen, Point72, and the firm’s president at the time, Douglas Haynes, charging them with fostering an environment that is hostile to women and accusing them of paying women less than their male peers. (In a statement, a Point72 spokesperson said that Bonner’s complaint was “without merit” and “replete with allegations that are either false or based on unsubstantiated hearsay.”) In the past year and a half, while companies in the movie business, advertising, media, and other industries have had toxic workplace cultures exposed and faced calls for accountability over gender discrimination and harassment, the financial sector has largely escaped public attention. Bonner’s case brought the ", ".", "Her lawsuit accuses executives at Point72 of paying her substantially less than several “lesser-qualified” male peers, and of being generally reluctant to promote women at the firm. Out of a hundred and twenty-five portfolio managers at Point72, according to the complaint, only one is female, and the hiring committee tasked with bringing in investment professionals is exclusively male. The suit also accuses certain company executives, including Haynes, of commenting on female employees’ looks, and other male executives—among them Mark Herr, the company’s head of corporate communications—of describing women at the company as “hysterical” and saying that women aren’t as hardworking as men. The firm’s chief operating officer, Tim Shaughnessy, is accused of holding “no girls allowed” meetings, while other unnamed male executives are cited as stating that they try to avoid hiring or promoting women. In one baffling episode that Bonner recounts in her complaint, Haynes, a former McKinsey director whom Cohen had installed as president of the firm, left the word “pussy” scrawled on a whiteboard in his glass-walled office for weeks, with no apparent explanation. In her previous jobs, at Bridgewater and at tech companies, Bonner told me, “I was the only woman in the room, but I was treated with respect.” At Point72, by contrast, “it felt creepy.” She said that other female employees she spoke to had made note of the “pussy” written on Haynes’s whiteboard, but that everyone was too uncomfortable to say anything about it. (Haynes could not be reached for comment.)", "Recently, Bonner agreed to meet with me to discuss her case. We sat together in an airy conference room in the offices of the Wigdor law firm, in downtown Manhattan. Since filing her lawsuit, Bonner has continued to report to work every day, and she told me what that has been like. Mostly, it has been awkward; she believes that people are scared to talk to her. Conversations tend to end when she enters a room, and she says that her responsibilities have been reduced, so she  feels that there isn’t all that much for her to do. Still, she remains employed at Point72.  “Look, we make a lot of money in this business, and there’s no way to mince words about that,” Bonner told me—in 2018, according to her lawsuit, she expected to make a three-hundred-thousand-dollar base salary and a bonus of two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. “But fairness and equality should still apply. And if someone like me, with my background, can’t be paid at parity,", " or break down some of the doors, I don’t know who can. . . . A lot of the women around me had mortgages, had kids, were primary breadwinners, or were more junior and hadn’t worked at other places, didn’t have track records, didn’t have relationships. And there was so much fear. I just thought, I don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t do something about it.”", "When Bonner was being hired at Point72, she pitched the firm on an idea that she believed would help diversify its employee pool while at the same time improving its profits. The past few years have been difficult for many hedge funds, as average returns have sagged despite a boom in the stock market. This dynamic makes it more difficult for funds to justify the high fees they charge their clients, and competition among funds for the brightest and most talented employees has grown increasingly intense. Bonner believed that her idea could help the company recruit the best people, which would give it an advantage over competitors. “Contrarian thought is always the money-making thought, so you’re looking for differentiated thinking,” Bonner said. “That also means that the actual business case for diversity has never been stronger in financial services than it is now.” Her idea was to create a proprietary system—she could not describe it in detail, due to a nondisclosure agreement—that would use algorithms and data analysis to help the company screen for prospective employees with atypical backgrounds. “If you know what the right traits of a great investor are, you don’t have to keep hiring the president of the investment club at Wharton,” Bonner told me. “You can find the person who’s majoring in agriculture in Iowa. We found someone in Tehran who I really liked. You can find people who have the raw intrinsics of what you want but, by nature of not growing up in New Canaan and playing lacrosse and going to Wharton, they have a different perspective, and that’s financially valuable to us.” Point72 agreed to let her develop the new recruiting system in addition to doing the main job that she was being hired for. Bonner started working at Point72 in August of 2016.", "Point72 was initially set up to invest Cohen’s personal eleven-billion-dollar fortune, but from the start Cohen—with an eye toward an eventual return to managing outside investors’ money—tried to distance himself from the reputation that had formed around S.A.C. He pushed out his previous team of executives, hired new compliance officers, and pledged to run a rule-abiding company. (On the “Our Story” page of the Point72 Web site, the words “Ethics,” “Excellence,” and “Opportunity” are the first thing you see. The first point in the company’s values statement reads, “We are professionals who conduct ourselves ethically and with integrity at all times.”) In January, when Cohen became eligible to manage other people’s money again, he quickly raised about three billion dollars from outside investors.", "In her complaint, Bonner says that she tried for months, to no avail, to get her salary and title adjusted to be on par with comparable male employees at the firm. Women just didn’t seem to be taken seriously, she said, no matter how strongly they were performing. The lawsuit quotes the firm’s chief legal officer saying that “the reality is that this is just a really tough place for women and that’s not going to change.” Bonner received glowing performance reviews, according to her complaint, and her recruiting platform was embraced as a success. Still, men with resumes thinner than hers continued being hired for positions above hers. Filing a lawsuit, she told me, “was my last option.”", "A few weeks after Bonner filed her case, Point72 announced that it was hiring Jamie Gorelick, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, to lead an internal review of its culture. Around the same time, Haynes—the executive who’d had “pussy” written on his office whiteboard—resigned from the firm. “For the first time, it felt like I had my dignity back,” Bonner said. (On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Mike Butler, Point72’s head of human resources, had decided to retire.)", "Point72 is fighting vigorously against Bonner’s lawsuit, and, if it goes to trial, the firm is likely to argue that Bonner was paid exactly what she deserved. But part of the power of her complaint is that the professional environment it portrays doesn’t seem so unusual; rather, it seems utterly familiar to many people who have worked on Wall Street—women being undervalued, talked over, given less important work, passed over for promotions, and forced to listen to banter about strip clubs. Bonner’s claims are notable for their ordinariness.", "I asked Bonner why she thought that more discrimination cases haven’t been filed against Wall Street companies. She paused for a moment. “Someone asked me recently if it’s as bad as it is, why haven’t more women come out?” she said. “My response is, more women haven’t come out because it is as bad as it is. That’s why. It’s a small club, and it’s an all-boys club, and people are terrified of not getting another job.” She went on, “When you’re paid less than someone who’s doing the exact same job, and probably at the same performance level as well, women start to develop a sense of, ‘I’m lucky to have this job. If I’m not paid as much, God, I’m lucky to", " even be here.’ ”"]},

In discussing South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s reciprocal visit to Pyongyang next fall, Kim advised him to fly because North Korea’s ", " are so bad—an unprecedented admission of failure by a country that long claimed to be a socialist paradise. He publicly acknowledged “defectors,” rather than the “scum of the earth,” as they’re labelled in Pyongyang. At the evening banquet, Kim smiled, bantered, and generally charmed as he moved among tables toasting and hugging officials of a country with which he is technically at war. For the evening entertainment, he brought along a magician who captivated the audience by turning a folded dollar bill into a hundred bucks.", "In South Korea, Kim is no longer simply the porky princeling with a bizarrely square coif who killed his way to the top by ordering the assassinations of a powerful uncle and a half brother—among others. “Before, he had a notorious image,” Moon Chung-in, a Presidential adviser on inter-Korean affairs, told me this week. “He had been seen as a demon, evil, impulsive, irrational. That was not the case at the banquet. He was quite rational, reasonable, accommodating, and accessible.” President Moon later described Kim to aides as “frank, open-minded, and courteous.” The North Korean never invoked the superiority of a nuclear power—which he is, and Moon is not.", "Among progressives in Seoul’s government circles and conservatives who oppose them, there’s now a sense that Kim will more than match wits with President Trump. At the Korean talks, Kim had a mastery of the issues “from A to Z,” the Presidential adviser added. “At the age of thirty-four, he’s really mature. He didn’t need help from aides or assistants. Moon was quite surprised.”", "Kim’s charm offensive is working. Before the summit, only ", " of South Koreans said that they trusted the North Korean leader—the third in a dynasty that has ruled Pyongyang ruthlessly for seven decades. After the summit, public faith in his good intentions catapulted to almost eighty per cent. Seoul has been abuzz with speculation that Kim’s youth and years at a Swiss middle school have molded him into a modernizer with a pragmatic streak. Overnight, he’s become a global player.", "The summit and its tightly choreographed pageantry produced “the kind of publicity that would normally cost a billion dollars,” Nam Sung-wook, the former head of the Institute for National Security Strategy, told me. Public interest in the Kim persona has been so intense that a major South Korean newspaper hired ", " to decipher what Kim said as he sat with Moon on a park bench.", "Kim, of course, may not actually have changed all that much. Even South Koreans who were impressed with his performance admitted that he was playing to the almost three thousand assembled journalists—and foreign leaders, notably Trump, watching from afar. He’s still secretive, suspicious, and scheming. Kim ", ", Korean officials told me, so as not to leave behind waste that could be diagnosed for health conditions—or anything else. He brought his own pens and pencils, too. Staff wiped off anything he touched. Not so much as a fingerprint was left behind.", "What’s Kim really up to in his overture to Moon, Trump, and the outside world? The analytical gossip mill in Seoul identifies three theories.", "The most optimistic assessment—somewhat surrealistic, given his past—contends that Kim has shifted strategy. Since assuming power after his father’s death, in 2011, his two-pronged ", " has been ", "—or “parallel advance”—of North Korea’s nuclear program and economy to create a “great socialist nuclear power.” But, in a speech on April 21st, Kim ", " the final victory of ", ". North Korea had achieved its nuclear capability, he said, and can henceforth focus on bettering the lives of its people.", "“He’s an enlightened young man,” Moon, the Presidential adviser who attended the other two inter-Korean summits, in 2000 and 2007, and who has visited Pyongyang eight times, told me. “You can clearly see a change in his strategic thinking to reconstruction of a socialist economy. He wants a normal state with foreign investment.”", "During the inter-Korean summit, the adviser recounted, Kim told President Moon that North Korea would not need a nuclear weapon—or make its people suffer to achieve it—if the United States agreed to meet more frequently, foster trust, and formally end the Korean War with a non-aggression treaty.", "“The real threat to Kim comes from within, unless he feeds his people well. And weapons cannot feed the North Korean people,” the Presidential adviser told me. He recounted asking a North Korean official what the regime meant by security. “What he said was a Trump Tower coming to the Taedong River and a McDonald’s and U.S. banks in Pyongyang—then the United States will never attack us,” he said.", "The second assessment is that Kim", " has decided to follow the course of other Asian Communists who introduced reforms and reëngaged with the world after long periods of isolation: in the nineteen-eighties, Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” policy paved the way for entrepreneurship, foreign investment, and global engagement—and transformed China. In the nineteen-nineties, Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt was a leader of Vietnam’s ", ", or “Renovation” policy, to create a “market-oriented socialist economy,” which ended the country’s postwar isolation.", "“Kim’s transforming—from being a totalitarian despot to becoming an authoritarian dictator,” Yoon Young-kwan, a former foreign minister now at Seoul National University, who has also visited Pyongyang, told me. What’s the difference? I asked. “A despot wants to close his country, his society,” he replied. “A dictator will accept market mechanisms and allow his people to enjoy economic freedoms, if not political freedoms.” It’s a model also followed by right-wing military dictators in Latin America in the nineteen-sixties, he added, and by Park Chung-hee, the dictator and former general who modernized South Korea in the nineteen-sixties and seventies.", "The timing of Kim’s shift, South Koreans told me, reflects the intersection of North Korea’s nuclear capability and the squeeze of economic sanctions, particularly on the country’s three-million-strong élite, in a country of twenty-five million. “This is the sweet spot—the time North Korea can get maximum concessions from the United States at a time of maximum need,” Kim Jung, a director at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, told me. The North Korean leader—who was not initially groomed for power—also now seems more secure after seven years in office, especially compared with his famously ", " father, who was ", " to public speaking. “It was a surprise to see that Kim is very relaxed and confident and smiley,” he added. “He was more competent than I thought. He was very well prepared for this international stage.”", "The third assessment—and the deep fear across Seoul—is that Kim is a master gamesman who is duping Moon, Trump, and the rest of the world. Even amid growing confidence that North Korea is willing to give up some of its bombs and ballistic missiles, there’s anxiety that Pyongyang has no intention of giving up everything. The regime doesn’t want to surrender the nuclear arsenal that finally—after seven decades and periods of deprivation that starved millions—makes North Korea a global power. It doesn’t want to appear to capitulate.", "“To survive, Kim needs those nuclear weapons,” Hahm Chaibong, the president of the Asan Institute, told me. Without the bomb and delivery systems, North Korea becomes a poor backwater country that struggles just to generate electricity.", "For all the euphoria in Seoul, the three-page Panmunjom Declaration, which sprang from the Korean summit, was vague. The declaration pledged to denuclearize “on the Korean Peninsula,” and that was taken by some experts in Seoul to also include the withdrawal of the U.S. “nuclear umbrella” protecting the South and, de facto, the twenty-eight thousand U.S. troops. It did not spell out North Korea’s nuclear-weapons obligations, unlike the ", ", which stipulated that neither North Korea nor South Korea could test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons.", "“There was nothing on substance,” Chaibong warned. “If you were to be kind, you’d say everything has to be decided between Trump and Kim anyway. It was a pre-summit summit. But if you were to be skeptical and cynical, as analysts are supposed to be, you’d say there has been no forward movement whatsoever as far as the North Korean denuclearization agenda is concerned.”", "Chung Yung-woo, a former national-security adviser and chief negotiator with North Korea, is among the most skeptical. For years, he was a frequent visitor to North Korea. “Kim is playing a high-risk, high-return survival game,” he told me. “He’s far more sophisticated than his grandfather,” Kim Il Sung, who led North Korea from the time it was established, in 1948, until he died, in 1994. “He’s far more strategic, not swayed by emotions. That’s why he wins every time he plays games with the outside world. So far, he’s never lost a bet.”"]},

What’s wrong with them?”", "“Wait, you won two games!”", "“No!” he said. “I don’t want to win any games!”", "David wanted the Jets to tank, so that the team could secure a better draft pick.

Rosen is the son of a Jewish father and a Quaker mother. He had a bar mitzvah but attended a Catholic high school, where he went to weekly mass and gave confession twice a semester.", "Since Sid Luckman, who threw his last pass in 1950, there hasn’t been a star Jewish quarterback in the N.F.L. There have been hardly any Jewish quarterbacks in the N.F.L. at all. Historically, the position has mostly been reserved for a very specific sort of person: white, Christian, preferably blue-collar. If he can passably appear in a commercial for Wrangler jeans, all the better. (No quarterback has fit the mold as well as the longtime Green Bay Packer ", ".) Black quarterbacks especially have been excluded—something worth keeping in mind as the N.F.L. ", " in response to his protests of police shootings of black Americans—though ", ". The former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy told me, “When I was coming into the league, the question was: Could a team rally around someone who didn’t necessarily look like them, or what they thought he should look like?” Last year, two Ph.D. students at Penn State “found substantial racial differences in ", ".” Scouting reports are more likely to find that white quarterbacks “fit the prototype” and are “leaders,” while black quarterbacks are “athletic” but have “deficits.”", "What about Jewish passers?

Perhaps the most harmful insinuation about Rosen is that he would be a subversive presence on the team. Last month, ", " quoted an anonymous N.F.L. executive ", ", “Can he lead? Can he fit into a locker room? He’s considered aloof.” Anonymous scouts wonder whether he can be coached.", "His coach at U.C.L.A., Jim Mora, said that is nonsense. “I have never one time, never one single time, seen him be disrespectful,” Mora told me. “I’ve never seen him question authority. I’ve seen him be very, very gracious.” Mora and Rosen recently had a falling out, after Mora said that a team that drafts Rosen would need to keep him intellectually stimulated—that, as a player, Rosen always insisted on knowing ", ". The sports-media machine ran with it as evidence of Rosen’s arrogance. (Rosen tweeted, acidly, “", "?”) Mora told me, “As I go back and I think about it, I’m, like, ‘Why did I say that, when I firmly believe that Josh Rosen’s the best player in the draft?’ ” (A few minutes after our call ended, Mora tweeted at Rosen, saying that the criticism of the quarterback is “so far off,” and the two seemed to make up.) The notion that teams wouldn’t want a smart quarterback is baffling, Mora said. Dungy told me that the quarterback Peyton Manning, whom Dungy coached in Indianapolis for seven years, was one of the smartest people he has ever met, and no one viewed that as a bad quality. Alan Freedman, the founder of the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, told me that this is a common criticism of Jewish athletes, a way to deny their athleticism.

Meanwhile, one commentator implied that Rosen’s “atheism” may make it impossible for him to fit in. Stephen A. Smith, the co-host of ESPN’s “First Take,” recently kicked up controversy by saying that Rosen would prefer to play in New York so that he could live among Jews. It was a ridiculous statement.

The tightly choreographed multinational operation—involving aircraft and ships in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf—took less than two hours. More than a hundred missiles—nearly double the size of the 2017 U.S. strike on Syria—hit their targets. A production site, command post, and storage facilities were obliterated. Neither the Russians nor Iranians tried to ", ". Syria’s air defenses failed miserably. All allied aircraft and personnel returned safely to their bases. “A perfectly executed strike last night,” Trump ", ", on Saturday morning. “Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!”", "Technically, that’s true. The limited military operation—far smaller than the advance hype suggested—did degrade Syrian President ", " against civilians. But it did not eliminate Syria’s entire stock, the Pentagon acknowledged, in a press briefing on Saturday. “The program is larger than what we struck,” Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie told reporters. “We could have gone to other places and done other things.” The six-day run-up to the strike may also have allowed sufficient time for Syria to relocate equipment and personnel, the Pentagon said.", "More fundamentally, however, Trump’s strike was a tactical response that lacks a long-term strategy to help restore stability to turbulent Syria. A country that is the geostrategic center of the Middle East, Syria has been ravaged by seven years of a war that has killed an estimated half million people and displaced more than half of its twenty-three million citizens. The U.S.-led military operation did nothing to change those realities—or even challenge Assad’s brutal rule or his growing military grip on the country.", "“So you strike. Then what?” Ryan Crocker, a former Ambassador to Syria (as well as Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Kuwait), told me. “If the rockets hit the targets they intended, you could say the mission was accomplished in a narrow sense. But, in reality, it accomplished nothing. It might have been better if we’d not struck at all. It’s sending a message that killing is O.K. any way but one way—with chemical weapons. How many have been killed in Eastern Ghouta during this whole Syrian campaign? Far more by non-chemical means. It’s obscene.”", "The strike, Crocker said, demonstrated the limits of the West’s power rather than its commitment to ending the murderous reign of the Assad family, which has ruled Syria for nearly half a century. The operation could even produce the “appearance of impotence” among Western nations. “What damage did we really do?” Crocker, now a fellow at Princeton University, asked. “You can strike once, which we did. The second time around is less meaningful. The Syrians keep using“—chemical weapons—“and we say, ‘Naughty, naughty.’ It tees up a great opportunity for Assad to show how impotent and irrelevant we are.”", "Like many U.S. diplomats who have served in the region, Crocker said that he is still waiting for a diplomatic vision to end the war, not simply a military plan to deal with one repugnant tactic. “It seems like the policy right now is not to have a policy. Syria is not a military problem. It is a political problem.”", "Diplomacy on Syria has stalled badly and, over the past year, bifurcated. Since 2012, the U.N. has convened a series of peace initiatives in Geneva. But the Assad government and various opposition groups (far from fully representative of the country’s deeply fractured militias and political factions) have balked on basics. Among the biggest issues are whether Assad can stay in power through a transition or even run in a future election. The rival sides have often refused even to sit in the same room. At a White House briefing on Saturday, a senior Administration official faulted the Assad government for refusing to participate, “aided and abetted by the Russians, who have been unwilling to exert the pressures to bring them to Geneva.”", "In 2017, a second process was launched, by a troika—Russia, Iran, and Turkey. But several meetings also failed to produce anything tangible. The Trump Administration said it hopes that the strike will, as a byproduct, add more steam to diplomacy. At the White House briefing on Saturday, however, senior officials offered no new ideas about how that might happen.", "“In all fairness, the attacks were not to change the basic order of battle on the ground or decapitate regime leaders,” Fred Hof, a former military officer and an ambassador who worked on Middle East issues for the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Obama Administrations, told me. “But it’s the follow-up that is everything. And, unless there is a strong diplomatic follow-up to this strike, it’s sound and fury signifying nothing. It’ll just be an empty gesture, as it was a year ago.”", "Hof warned that the Assad regime may interpret the strike as a license to be even more brutal. “The focus is entirely on the weapon rather than the crime,” he said. “When Assad sees a bright red line being drawn against one particular compound, this man’s cynicism makes him believe he has a green light for every other damn thing.”", "Given the tensions among the major powers following  the strike, diplomacy seems ever further away. In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin called the U.S.-led strike an “act of", " aggression.” The Russian foreign ministry charged that it was designed to derail an investigation into the chemical-weapons attack in Douma a week ago. Moscow has alleged that videos and photos of convulsing toddlers were a plot by foreign powers. Russia introduced a resolution in an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Saturday condemning the strikes. It failed. But the comments during the debate reflected the depth of divisions.", "Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., said that President Trump informed her that “the United States is locked and loaded” and ready to strike again if Syria resumes its use of chemical weapons. “When our President draws a red line, our President enforces the red line,” she said. Haley also charged that Russia was complicit in Syria’s use of chemical weapons because it failed to insure that Damascus had destroyed its stockpile, as it promised, in 2013, in an international agreement brokered by the Obama Administration. The consequences of the second U.S. strike on Syria have yet to play out. As the Pentagon noted, U.S. forces deployed there are still trying to mop up the remnants of ", ", which has a few thousand fighters in the eastern Euphrates Valley.

When they arrived in Mogadishu, in 2007, gangs of Al Shabaab fighters controlled much of the city. A.U. troops established a base in Mogadishu’s southern suburbs and attempted to protect a Western-backed transitional government. In reality, they only controlled a handful of embattled city blocks and a Presidential palace under siege. In 2011, A.U. forces launched an offensive that pushed Al Shabaab fighters out of the city, but fighting continued in pockets, and the Islamists’ presence on the outskirts of the city continued to threaten the capital.

Last summer, the Trump Administration expanded those operations. African Union commanders say that the American drone strikes have restricted the movements of Al Shabaab fighters. A group that once stood and fought them ferociously is more cautious with American drones in the skies.

Regional political divisions and rifts between clans have slowed efforts to reach a consensus on how the country’s security institutions should be structured. Corruption is endemic. In December, the U.S. suspended aid to some of Somalia’s security forces because graft was so pervasive.

Last Friday, a jury acquitted her on all counts. Several\nhours later, she walked out of the federal courthouse in Orlando in the\nsame black blazer she’d worn throughout the trial. She climbed into the\npassenger seat of her attorney’s car, fastened her seat belt, and\nsobbed. Apart from one interview with the New York ", ", in 2016,\nSalman has not spoken publicly since the attack. She did not take the\nstand in court. Through her attorneys, she turned down repeated requests\nfor interviews. For some, particularly the family members of Pulse\nvictims, the verdict may not lead to much peace. But, after observing\nlarge parts of the trial, I believe that Salman’s ordeal is, perhaps more\nthan anything, a cautionary tale. From the start, it was a weak case\nfrom federal prosecutors, filled with missteps and contradictory\ntestimony by the F.B.I. and also a deep and abiding misunderstanding of\nthe nature of life for victims of domestic abuse.", "On the night of the attack, Salman was awoken at her house, as was her\nson, and both were taken to the local F.B.I. office, in Fort Pierce,\nFlorida, where she was questioned for nearly a dozen hours. She never\nasked for an attorney. She never asked to leave. For the first three and\na half hours, she operated under the assumption that she could be\nreturning home to her husband—the man who raped her, she said, who\nthreatened to take her son, who threatened to take her life. The man who\nstrangled her and controlled her daily activities. And more than\nanything, perhaps, the man who showed her, in 2013—when the F.B.I.\nquestioned and then cleared him for suspicious comments that he had made in\nsupport of violent extremism—how he was capable of outsmarting the\nsystem, because the system had let him go. For those first three and a\nhalf hours, before she knew for certain that her husband was dead, her\nsenses were geared toward her and her son’s survival.", "Salman did not know the extent of Mateen’s carnage, nor how sprawling\nthe investigation into the massacre would become. Police shot and killed\nMateen at 5:17 ", ", and F.B.I. Special Agent T. J. Sypniewski finally informed Salman that he\nwas dead sometime around 8:30 ", ". On the witness stand,\nSypniewski described her as dry-eyed over this news. “She didn’t cry;\nshe expressed no emotion,” he told the court. Sypniewski’s colleague,\nSpecial Agent Christopher Mayo, was also interviewing Salman with\nSypniewski. Mayo testified that Salman had actually sobbed when she\nheard the news. This was one of many inconsistencies in the F.B.I.\nagents’ testimonies, a factor that the jury foreman said, after the\ntrial, had figured into the jury's acquittal. The foreman’s statement\nalso pointed out that the F.B.I. did not record the interview—a practice\nthat Swift, the defense attorney, said he believes should become\nstandard for all future F.B.I. interviews.", "Salman entered the F.B.I. office believing herself the wife of an\nabuser, and learned that she was a widow. Suddenly, she no longer lived\nunder the authoritarian rule of a man who watched grisly beheading\nvideos on his phone while at work. Salman’s defense attorneys used very\nlittle of her history of abuse in their arguments, because the larger\npoint for them was to convince jurors that she did not know of his plans\nbefore the attack unfolded. But from my viewpoint her victimhood was\nboth entirely pertinent and shockingly disregarded by both the F.B.I.\ninvestigators and, later, by the federal prosecutors who chose to put\nher on trial.", "Law-enforcement officials are not always familiar with the control that abusers\nhave over their victims. They frequently encounter the following\nscenario: responders are called to a scene of domestic violence in a\nhome. When they arrive, often to their dismay and annoyance, the victim\nbegins to scream at them to go away, to tell them they aren’t wanted,\neven to holler obscenities at them. This happens even when a victim’s\nphysical injuries—black eyes, bloody wounds—are obvious. Police often\ninterpret this behavior as evidence that the victim is mentally or\nemotionally unstable. But this behavior is a message not to law\nenforcement, but to the abuser. It says, “I know you will be here when\nthey are gone. I am loyal even in the face of your violence.” It says,\n“Please don’t kill me when they are gone.”", "I believe Salman was a passive prisoner in her own home, the ward of a\nguard she had vowed to spend her life with. He made sure that she had no\nmeans to escape him. He kept her from working, told her that he’d get\nfull custody of their child if she left, and gave her a pittance of\ntwenty dollars a week to spend. She was his longest-enduring victim.\nToday, she is another", " survivor.", "The prosecution’s case was based primarily on a confession that was\nwritten by an F.B.I. agent and that Salman signed after nearly twelve\nhours of questioning. The average F.B.I. interrogation lasts ninety\nminutes, Charles Swift pointed out, in his closing argument. When she\nsigned it, Salman was physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted.\nEarly on in the trial, forensic evidence revealed that multiple\nstatements in the confession were false.", "Salman’s claim that she “cased” Pulse with her husband was not true.\nBefore the night of the massacre, neither she nor Mateen had ever been\nin the vicinity of the night club.

Swift\npointed out that if Mateen didn’t know his target until the moment it\nbecame his target, how could his wife have known? During his closing argument,\nSwift also showed the jury, with the help of a red marker, all the parts\nof Salman’s signed confession that were demonstrably false. By the end\nof his argument, only half of the confession remained unmarked.", "More damning still for the F.B.I. was that, after the prosecution rested\nits case, information was revealed to the jury that Mateen’s father,\nSeddique, had been an informant for the F.B.I. for eleven years, and had\nwire-transferred funds to Turkey and Afghanistan in the weeks before the\nattacks. Jurors learned that the F.B.I. had even once considered\ngrooming Omar Mateen as an informant. Why the F.B.I. decided that he did\nnot represent a threat to public safety, after investigating him for ten\nmonths, in 2013, was not clarified during the trial. Mateen’s father,\nhowever, is now currently under investigation.", "A day before closing arguments began, I sat down with the Salman family, in a restaurant catering to\nmotorcycle enthusiasts—crotch rockets and cruisers with blistering\nshines on their fenders were on display, and heavy metal pounded through\nthe speakers. We discussed how the past two years have been for them.\nDuring the trial, the defense presented details of Salman’s\nspecial-education classes, her below-average I.Q., her lifelong\ncognitive challenges. For the family, it was an unnecessary public\nshaming. “All her life, we’ve tried to build her up. And all this year,\nwe have destroyed her,” Al Salman, her uncle, told me. “We are forever\nchanged.”", "Susan Adieh, whom Noor refers to as “Auntie,” was more outspoken. “Why\nis this happening?

I spoke with Al a little\nlater by phone. He talked about Noor needing a good therapist, and how\nhe’d watched the jury members taking notes throughout the trial; he knew\nthey were taking it seriously, and it gave him faith in the outcome.\nThen I asked him if there was anything else he wanted to say that I\nhadn’t asked.

It was\nremarkable that Federer got so many of them back at all.

Del Potro began moaning to the chair\numpire, Fergus Murphy, about Fed fans yelling during his service motion.\n(They were also cheering any time he netted a serve.) Then, when del\nPotro served an ace to bring the tiebreak score to 3-3, Federer began\nbarking at Murphy for not seeing that the ball was clearly out, and then\nmade a sweeping circle with his racquet a few inches behind the service\nline, where he was certain the ball had landed. Federer eventually made\na formal challenge, and Hawk-Eye showed that the ball was clearly in.\nFed kept grousing anyway. Del Potro did, too; things were tense.

A young American hopeful, she grew up,\nin Miami, idolizing them. Her mother, Paula Liverpool, took a second job\ntending bar in a strip club so that her daughter, a young teen-ager\nthen, could continue to train and play tennis. Liverpool is a\ncollege-educated immigrant from Guyana, with no sports background, but\nSachia had received free lessons from a local coach, grown serious about\nthe game, and started riding Greyhound buses to tournaments. Last week,\nat twenty-two, she earned her way as a qualifier into the Indian Wells\nmain draw, where she first defeated Eugenie Bouchard and then stunned world No. 3 Garbiñe Muguruza,  before dropping her third-round\nmatch on Monday. Vickery is one of a handful of next-generation American\nwomen—none of them ranked in the Top 100 when the tournament began—whose\nplay has formed the big reveal of this year’s BNP Paribas Open.", "There was nineteen-year-old Caroline Dolehide, No. 165, a wild-card\nentry who won her first two matches, then overwhelmed world No. 1\n", ",\nwith forehands approaching a remarkable ninety miles per hour, in the\nfirst set of their third-round match—before tiring, fading, getting\nout-thought, and losing. There was Danielle Collins, another wild card,\nand one of those rare pros who played college tennis; she was a two-time\nN.C.A.A. singles champion at the University of Virginia. Now\ntwenty-four, and ranked No. 117, she out-slugged the U.S. Open finalist\nMadison Keys to score the biggest win of her fledgling career, before\nlosing on Tuesday. And there was Amanda Anisimova, daughter of Russian\nimmigrants and a phenom at the age of sixteen. Yet another wild-card\nentry, she belted her way to three early-round victories, among them a\nstraight-set upset of ninth-seeded Petra Kvitová.", "On Tuesday, Court 2 was jammed for Anisimova’s fourth-round match,\nagainst Karolína Plíšková, the tall, lean, big-hitting Czech who reached\nNo. 1 for a time last year. Anisimova is five feet eleven, and already\npossesses not only eye-popping power off of both wings but a feathery\ntouch and a court sense beyond her years. In the first set of her match\nagainst Plíšková, experience trumped nerves. But the second set was as\ngood as tennis has been in the Indian Wells Tennis Garden this year. It\nwas, in a sense, the kind of tennis the Williams sisters more or less\ninvented: first serves regularly reaching above a hundred and ten\nm.p.h.; step-in, big-swing groundstrokes from the baseline; swinging\nvolleys from mid-court. Plíšková, her aggression more controlled,\nprevailed in a second-set tiebreak to win, but Anisimova, a junior\nchampion, had announced her arrival.", "She and the other emerging players—along with Keys, ", ",\nand ", ",\nwho are already in the Top 50 and part of the tour establishment—suggest\nthat American women’s tennis is in a very good place. Not quite Williams\ngood, most likely—after all, there was only one Muhammad Ali, one Tiger\nWoods, one Michael Jordan. Venus and Serena have been that good: they\nare transcendent figures. One of the pleasures any sport affords is\nwatching young talent arrive, improve, and triumph. Another is watching\nthe greatest, like the Williams sisters, remain motivated, refine,\nretool. Enjoy them as their careers approach the end."]},

Kudlow formerly\nworked as a budget official in Ronald Reagan’s Administration, and as an\neconomist at the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns, before going\non to a career as a television personality on CNBC. That week, Donald\nTrump was accepting the Republican Party’s nomination for President.\nKudlow was one of very few economics professionals willing to publicly\nassociate themselves with Trump’s campaign—and some mainstream\neconomists considered Kudlow a fringe figure, a showman. The messages\ncoming out of Trump’s elastic policy wing were contradictory at best;\nTrump had indicated that he supported a handful of policies, such as\ndoing away with free-trade agreements, that would have gone against\nKudlow’s deep-rooted free-trade stance. But Trump had other ideas that\nwere less threatening. “When he put out a tax-reform plan . . . I looked\nat it, read it, and thought, Whoa! He’s slashing the corporate tax!”\nKudlow\n", " me at the time. The two men had known each other for years, and Trump\nwas a candidate whose views were morphing every day, and who was badly\nin need of intellectual guidance. The relationship represented something\nthat Kudlow hadn’t experienced in a very long time: the possibility of\ninfluence at the highest levels. All he needed to do was wait.", "More than a year and a half later, Kudlow received a very exciting phone\ncall. It was the President. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs\nexecutive who had been the top economic adviser in the White House, had\nquit after Trump announced his intention to place tariffs on imported\nsteel and aluminum. Trump wanted Kudlow to take over as the director of\nthe National Economic Council. “The President offered me the position\nlast night, and I accepted. I’m going down there tonight,” Kudlow told\nme when I reached him by phone on Wednesday. “I have a lot of things to\ndo, and I’m very excited and very honored to do this. Last time I worked\nin the White House was in Ronald Reagan’s first term. It’s taken a\nwhile, but now I’m going to be back. It’s a big thrill for me.”", "Regarding the economic issues that Trump is likely to want him to focus\non, Kudlow said, “The plate’s going to be full.” A second tax-cut bill\n(something Trump ", " at last month) will likely be on the agenda, he\nsaid, and also an infrastructure plan. Immigration would probably come\nup. “Trade is going to be a full issue,” he added.", "Kudlow acknowledged that there are quite a few subjects that he and\nTrump don’t agree on, although they definitely agree on some, such as the\nsanctity of aggressively reducing corporate tax rates. But in his view,\nKudlow said, the National Economic Council’s role is simply to offer\ninformation and expertise to the President, not to push any particular\ncourse of action. “The way I learned it, with Reagan, is you present the\narguments, you put the options down, and, once the President makes the\ndecision, that’s it,” he said. “Our job is to execute the policy\ndecisions. That will be our process. And, once he makes up his mind, you\ngo out there and do what he wants.”", "The tariffs on aluminum and steel that Trump announced last week stunned\nthe business community and were strongly opposed by Cohn. The backlash\nagainst the tariffs—from the Republican Party, the business world, other\ncountries, and many mainstream economists—was intense. Since then, Trump\nhas softened his statements somewhat, suggesting that the tariffs would\nnot be quite as broad as he originally suggested, and that he might\nexempt countries such as Canada and Mexico. Even though Kudlow regards\nhimself as ardently in favor of free trade, he said that he could live\nwith the tariffs. He argued that Reagan, his intellectual mentor, would\nhave approved of what Trump has done from an economic standpoint.\n“Reagan would love this,” Kudlow said. “Reagan was kind of an\nanti-establishment guy. He didn’t use the word ‘swamp,’ but, Reagan, he\nwas not a pal of Wall Street’s—he didn’t much care for the Washington\nestablishment. I think Reagan would look down admiringly on this. He’d\nsay, ‘Larry, go for it.’ ”", "He acknowledged that Reagan never liked “across the board” tariffs, but\ncountered that his Administration had used them on occasion. “We had\ngreat debates and he wound up providing some protections for the chip\nindustry, for the motorcycle industry,” Kudlow said. “I remember the\ndebates, about the motorcycles and the chips. Reagan did not like to use\nthat, but felt that there were times when tariffs were appropriate, at\nleast as a negotiating tool.”", "“Look, I didn’t like it when he announced across-the-board tariffs\naround the world,” Kudlow continued, referring to Trump. “On the other hand,\nin my conversations with the President in recent days, he’s made it very\nclear he doesn’t like tariffs either! I think you’ll see targeted\ntariffs, and that’s part of the game. China is probably going to be a\ntarget here.”", "Before he got off the phone to attend to a flurry of other calls and\nappointments, I asked Kudlow if he had any reservations at all about\njoining the Trump Administration—were there any questions he needed\nanswered, or due diligence he wanted to do before he could accept a", "position in the White House? “I can’t go deep,” he told me. “All I’ll\nsay is, we talked about a number of things and it was extremely\nsatisfactory to my way of thinking.”", "“We have a wonderful relationship,” Kudlow went on. “He called me this\nmorning, and I had been, you know, beavering away on the computer and\nwhatnot. I wasn’t watching TV, but apparently the story broke that he\nasked me and I accepted. And he said to me, ‘You’re all over it, you’re\nall over! I’m looking at your picture right now. Very handsome! Looks\ngood.’ ” Kudlow paused and chuckled. “He’s that way. A great sense of\nhumor.”"]},

He put Iran on notice that he\nwould “terminate” the nuclear deal—formally known by the longwinded title\nof the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A.—unless it agreed to\nchange the terms. “No one should doubt my word,” Trump said in a\nstatement.

For centuries, the\nneighboring Russian and Persian empires were rivals. They fought a\nseries of wars between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, forcing\nIran to cede territories to Russia in what are today the countries of\nGeorgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, plus other properties in the Caucasus\nand Central Asia. Russia’s occupation of Iran during the Second World\nWar—and its refusal to leave afterward—produced the first crisis of the new\nU.N. Security Council. President Harry Truman’s ultimatum to Stalin to\nwithdraw from Iran seeded the Cold War. Iran’s monarchy so feared the\nCommunist regime that it allowed the C.I.A. to build a key listening\npost along the border. After its 1979 Revolution, the new Islamic\nRepublic condemned its atheist neighbor to the north; “Neither East Nor\nWest” became the creed of its foreign policy.

It was medal night, and there\nwould be showdowns. Weir wore his hair in its usual updo—part of an\nongoing set of elegant but slightly hmm-inducing style choices that, as\na friend of mine put it, put him “on the verge of appropriation, tbh.” The\nevening was framed as a contest between two top young Russian figure\nskaters: the eighteen-year-old Evgenia Medvedeva and the\nfifteen-year-old Alina Zagitova, who are teammates, rivals, and friends,\nand who share a coach. Lipinski, a gold medallist twenty years ago who\nhad been the Zagitova to Michelle Kwan’s Medvedeva, seemed to be rooting\nfor the upstart. In practice, just for kicks, Zagitova had done a\nfive-triple combination—five triple jumps in a row. “That is ", ",”\nLipinski said. I had to agree.", "NBC, perhaps nervous about interest in a high-profile event with a\nnon-American focus, offered a helpful video to contextualize the night’s\ncompetition. “What do you picture when you think of ladies’ figure\nskating?” Lipinski narrated, as we looked at footage of Medvedeva. “Go\nahead: close your eyes.” The reel cut to Tonya Harding, looking grim,\nand Nancy Kerrigan, beaming, and Harding again, bedazzled and wincing\nabout her boot lace in Lillehammer. We saw Debi Thomas and Katarina\nWitt, looking tense; and, lo, there was young Lipinski, about to upstage\nKwan. “We picture them next to their greatest rivals,” Lipinski said.\n“No sport does rivalry better than this one.” We watched as Kwan skated\nelegantly, looking mature and hopeful, and as Lipinski, yellow-haired\nand riled up, skated hungrily, exuberantly.

We began with the\nsomewhat lower-ranked competitors. Kim Ha-nul, of South Korea, skated a\nlovely program to selections from “Mamma Mia!,” a bit of a musical\ncurveball; after looping and lutzing to “The Winner Takes It All,” she\nbowed, to wild home-country cheering, a near-anguished look of pride on\nher face. Maria Sotskova, also of Russia, skated to Debussy’s “Clair de\nLune”; Weir called her “the shy, quiet sister” who “proved she deserves\nto be watched.” He pointed out that she may not have their “pizzazz or\nprestige” but that she’d needed “that victory over ", " today.” I\nwas grateful, as ever, not to have my own live commentators.", "Chen, of California, skated to something called “Jealousy Tango.” The\nvenerable skating legend Dick Button, a no-nonsense presence on Twitter,\n", ",\n“She has the opportunity to be smoldering on the ice, but her skating\nand the music mean nothing to one another.”", "Tennell, from Illinois, skated to selections from “Cinderella”—we also\nsaw a photo of her as a child, dressed as Cinderella, and,\nbibbidi-bobbidi-boo, it was a delightful program, except for a “shocking\nmistake” on the double axel–triple toe, and a fall. “Her presentation is\na bit provincial,” Weir said. Choi Da-bin, of South Korea, whose mother\ndied, of cancer, in June, skated a moving routine to selections from\n“Dr. Zhivago” in a royal-blue sparkly dress; her mentor, the Olympic\nchampion and Pyeongchang cauldron lighter Yuna Kim, watched from the\nstands. After failing to combine her beautiful triple lutz with a triple\ntoe loop, she pulled it off later, to thrilling effect. The crowd, which\nknew her story, cheered after every marvel. In her short program, she\nhad skated to “Papa, Can You Hear Me?,” from “Yentl.” I decided I was\nrooting for her. She ended up with a personal-best score, which put her,\ntemporarily, in first place.", "Nagasu, skating to “Miss Saigon,” had a triple-axel misfire. I felt bad\nfor her: she was a wonder, but she made mistakes.

Button, however, wasn’t\nhappy. “Why is Nagasu flopping around the ice?” he\n", ".\nGolf talked about the United States’ history of skating greats, and\nwondered aloud what had happened to us.", "As the final, formidable group warmed up together, zipping around one\nanother like gorgeous, bejewelled sharks, Weir repeated a “brass\nknuckles under velvet gloves” remark he’d made in the short program,\nsavoring the imagery. Japan’s Satoko Miyahara skated a beautiful", " program\nto Puccini’s “Madame Butterfly,” and managed to emerge triumphant from a\nscrutinized triple-triple; her score was so high that it approached “Russian\nterritory,” Weir said. Carolina Kostner, of Italy, a bronze medallist in\nSochi, in 2014, wowed everybody with her various triple jumps, and also\nwith an intriguing jagged yet streamlined uniform that took the\nskin-vs.-costume mystery to a new level: spangles here, torso there, as\nif person and performance were one. Kaori Sakamoto, of Japan, skated a\nstrong, fanciful program to selections from “Amélie,” complete with the\nsounds of squeezebox and tweeting birds. At one point, she managed a\nfall by turning it into a hop. Weir called her choreography naïve and\nrefreshing; Lipinski called her technique “heaven.”", "Then it was Zagitova time. As she prepared to skate, she was both\nformidable and childlike, blowing her nose, scratching her thighs. She\nwore a bright-red dress with gold brocade and matching elbow gloves, red\nlipstick, her hair in a tight bun. She began by dancing to “Don\nQuixote,” seeming to vibrate with energy. Her stiff skirt stuck out like\na tutu on a music-box dancer. “These next four minutes could change her\nlife, Terry,” Lipinski said. She stacked the back half of her program\nwith hard jumps to earn more points. On our TV screens, the metre of her\ntechnical accomplishments, which in most skaters’ programs is a\ncombination of green, yellow, and red squares, was all green: perfect.\nHer jumps were timed to the music; each landing came with a triumphant\ninstrumental blast. So did the ending, her gloved arms poised in ta-da.", "“In Russia, patience is not a virtue!” Lipinski said. “Terry, has the\napprentice become the master?” Kaetlyn Osmond, of Canada, hadn’t been as\ntalked-about in all the Russian hubbub, and then dazzled everybody with\nthe most amiable “Black Swan” I’ve ever seen. In one instance, she was\npractically en pointe, tiptoeing on skates. At the end, her\nwell-deserved joy was obvious.", "“A swan has ", ", Terrence,” Weir said, enunciating with\nportentous glee.", "“John, I couldn’t have said it any better than that,” Golf said.", "Osmond’s double axel–triple toe was “like skipping stones across a\nplacid pond,” Weir said. She had skated second to last in the program;\nas her score was announced—second only to Zagitova’s—she let out a jolly\n“Ha ha ha HA!” She would get a medal.", "Earlier in the evening, a get-to-know-you video about Medvedeva had\ngiven us a picture of her teen exuberance: K-pop, J-pop, mall dancing,\nanime. We saw her skating dressed as the animated-series character\nSailor Moon, in knee socks and a miniskirt sailor suit.

(Her short program, the other night, was about “the\nflight of the soul” as it leaves the body at the point of “clinical\ndeath,” she had said.) Tonight, she was skating to “Anna Karenina.” She\nwore crimson and black, and, from a distance, the colors looked brown,\nlike the discreet plumage of a female bird.

It was a triple Salchow, with her arms\nraised over her head, and a triple toe loop, astonishingly graceful and\nmasterly. A riot of spinning seemed to express Anna Karenina’s descent\ninto despair; at the end, here was the final train sound, and Medvedeva\nraised a hand as if to say “halt.” Then it was over, and she cried.

Everyone involved in the discussions\nwanted the United States to push back against what they saw as Russian\naggression, but they were divided about how to do so. Some were wary of\nputting the C.I.A. back on a Cold War footing with Moscow. Senior\nofficials were also skeptical that covert-influence operations would be\neffective at punishing and deterring Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.\n“We suck at this,” one official told me. Obama’s advisers opted to use\neconomic sanctions instead. By the end of 2015, the idea of the\nPresident issuing a secret Presidential finding to authorize the C.I.A.\nto act against Moscow had been set aside as a serious option.", "Last Friday’s indictment of thirteen Russian nationals by Robert\nMueller, the special counsel in the investigation into Russian tampering\nwith the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, showed that, while Obama’s\nadvisers were wrestling with the pros and cons of launching a covert\ncampaign against Moscow, the Russians had already embarked on an\nambitious influence operation of their own in the United States.\n(Whether there was as much hand-wringing inside Putin’s Kremlin as there\nwas inside Obama’s White House, we don’t know, but most American\nofficials doubt it.)", "The indictment handed down last week has renewed a debate about whether\nObama did enough to counter the Kremlin when he was in office. President\nTrump weighed in over the weekend with a series of tweets, including one\nthat charged, “Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did\nnothing.” Obama did take some steps to punish the Russians for their\ninterference, expelling Russian diplomats and closing two of their\ndiplomatic facilities in the U.S. But a former senior Obama\nAdministration official I spoke to accused Trump of doing less to\ncounter the Russians than Obama did, saying, “What Obama did is on the\nrecord. What Trump has not done is on the record. He is the one who has\ndone nothing.” But at least some of Obama's advisers say they believe\nthat the former President should have done more. Last year, when I wrote\nabout the Russian operation for the Washington ", ", one of them told\nme and my colleagues, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller, “I feel like we\nsort of choked.” More senior officials in the Obama Administration\ncounter that the intelligence picture was incomplete at first. Later,\nwhen faced with tough choices about how to respond, Obama opted to\nretaliate after the election, rather than before, to avoid making\nmatters worse, the senior officials said. Contrary to Trump’s suggestion\nthat Obama “knew” what was happening, a former intelligence official\ntold me, “There was no singular moment where everything was known.”", "Though we are still a long way from having a complete understanding of\nRussia’s interference, and of what U.S. spy agencies knew and when they\nknew it, Friday’s indictment helped fill in the time line of how events\nunfolded. By mid-2014, the now infamous troll farm known as the Internet\nResearch Agency had begun its campaign with the stated goal of spreading\n“distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,”\naccording to the indictment. The National Security Agency sweeps up vast\namounts of Russian communications, but policymakers say they weren’t\nbriefed on the 2014 developments. It is unclear whether the new details\ndisclosed in the indictment were obtained by federal investigators using\ntheir subpoena powers or if the N.S.A. and other spy agencies delivered\nrelevant intercepts from 2014 after searching through their archives.\n(Mueller's team probably relied on both internal communications obtained\nvia court order and N.S.A. intercepts that weren’t translated in real\ntime but were pulled together after the fact.) Spy agencies collect so\nmany phone calls, e-mails, and faxes from around the world that they\noften don’t know what they have until they are asked to hunt for it by\ninvestigators.", "Now we know that the Russians involved in the election interference\nstepped up their efforts in 2015 by purchasing advertisements on\nsocial-media sites, but it remains unclear whether the F.B.I. or other\nintelligence agencies were aware of these purchases in real time. (Spy\nagencies monitor foreign communications, but privacy protections limit\ntheir ability to monitor traffic on social-media platforms frequented by\nAmericans.) By early 2016, a team of F.B.I. agents was tracking dozens\nof fictitious, Kremlin-backed online personas peddling pro-Russian\npropaganda to U.S. and Canadian news and opinion sites. But, in keeping\nwith longstanding practice in secretive counter-intelligence\ninvestigations, the F.B.I. kept this information within the confines of\nthe U.S. intelligence community, wary of compromising an ongoing probe\nthat might otherwise have dragged on indefinitely. F.B.I.\ncounterintelligence officials often spend years watching and learning\nhow adversaries operate in the United States without ever taking action\nagainst them or those who may be, wittingly or unwittingly, working on\ntheir behalf. (One former official compared counterintelligence work to\nstamp collecting or butterfly watching. When agents find something new,\nthey gather around and say, “isn’t that interesting.”)", "By the spring of 2016, one U.S. spy agency had issued a report\ndescribing a spike in Russian focus on the U.S. Presidential race. In\nretrospect, the intelligence looked prescient, but analysts stopped\nshort of predicting that Moscow planned to intervene in the election\nitself, and it is", " not clear that the report was provided to senior\nAmerican policymakers at the time, officials briefed on the findings\nsaid.", "“Other agencies saw signs of Russian disinformation efforts before the\nF.B.I.,” a former intelligence official told me. “Initially, it was\nbelieved that it was business as usual. The Russians always do this kind\nof thing. However, as the effort intensified and the number of people\ninvolved on the Russian side grew, it became clear that it was not\nbusiness as usual. It was a bigger and more varied operation.” But the\nofficial said that it took time for the agencies to understand what they\nwere picking up and disseminate it to policymakers.", "In summer of 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies had collected what\nthe former intelligence official described as a “critical mass” of\ninformation about Russian efforts to intervene in the election,\nprompting John Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A., to brief Obama\nand other top advisers in August about the threat. Updates were provided\nas information came in. But readers of the President’s Daily Brief, or\nP.D.B., a top-secret digest of the U.S. government’s most closely held\nintelligence reports, didn’t learn the scope of the Russian effort,\nincluding that the F.B.I. had been tracking the use of fake personas\nonline, or that the Russians were exploiting Facebook and other\nsocial-media sites, until well after Election Day, officials said. “We\nknew some things, but didn’t have all the pieces,” a senior official\nsaid, referring to Obama's final weeks in office.", "It has been a year since Trump became President. He is now pointing to\nObama’s failure to act, and it is legitimate to question the former\nAdministration’s decisions. But current and former Trump advisers say\nthat his Administration, which, like Obama’s, has its own internal\ndivisions on Russia and how to respond to the latest intelligence, has\ndone little itself to counter the threat. In fact, these advisers say,\nTrump has himself, at times, undermined efforts to address the issue.\nLast year, some officials said they were reluctant to raise the Russia\nthreat in meetings, worried that they’d upset the boss. That made it\nharder to have substantive, high-level discussions within the White\nHouse about possible responses. We still don't know all the details\nabout Russia’s operation, and about who knew what and when. We learned a\nlot last week, from Mueller’s team. Will we ever know the full story?\nI’m not sure."]},

When I arrived, a small crowd\nof young people were milling around on the corner of Coral Springs Drive\nand Holmberg Road, some of them in black funeral wear, having come from ", ". An ambulance pulled up to treat a student who, apparently\nsuffering from heat stroke, sat on the street corner. I walked up to a\ngroup of teen-age girls to ask what was going on. They were wearing\nmaroon and white, the school colors of Stoneman Douglas, and it wasn’t until\none student, a fifteen-year-old sophomore named Catherine Silva, started\ntelling me why they were there that I realized that they were from\nanother school, West Boca Raton High. That morning, Silva told me, their\nschool had held a seventeen-minute silence for each of the students and\nstaff members who had died in the shooting, after which a spontaneous\nprotest had erupted: a thousand of the students had decided to leave\nschool, and they had simply kept walking the twelve miles southwest to\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High.", "“Everyone started leaving the gates of the school, and people were\ntrying to prevent us, like, assistant principals were trying to tell us, ‘No, no, no, go back,’ so we just stampeded through the gates,” Silva\ntold me, a note of elation in her voice. “I think I was one of the first\npeople who was, like, ‘We’re walking to Marjory, we’re walking to Marjory\nStoneman Douglas High School. We’re going. We’re walking all the way\nthere.’ ”", "She gestured at the group of sunburned and sweaty teen-agers around her,\nsome with their shirts off, some standing around talking with the\nStoneman Douglas students in their funeral clothes. “We have to do this\nourselves because, frankly, no one’s going to do this for us.

I’ll just\nscream my lungs out until something is done. Change is necessary. We\nneed change to be safe.”", "As I spoke to Silva outside the school, and as the buses drove toward\nTallahassee, Florida House Republicans blocked a motion to debate a ban\non assault weapons in the state. They spent more time on the afternoon\nof February 20th debating a resolution to declare pornography a\npublic-health risk.", "By air in a puddle jumper from Fort Lauderdale, the approach to\nTallahassee, at the eastern edge of the Florida Panhandle, is from the\nwest, a descent over the humid green expanse of the Apalachicola\nNational Forest.

Six days after the shooting, the activists’\nvisit would mark their first major meetings with lawmakers—not just\nany lawmakers, but one of the most pro-gun state legislatures in the country.", "A welcome ceremony had been arranged for the Stoneman Douglas students\nat a local school, Leon High. At 9:30 ", ", with word that the first bus\nwas approaching the outskirts of Tallahassee, hundreds of students and\nstaff from Leon stood on the front steps of the school, a W.P.A.-era\nbuilding with a broad sloping lawn and a grand flight of stairs, ready\nto welcome their peers from Parkland. As the bus reached the driveway,\nthe crowd grew silent. A teacher from Leon told me that they had been\ninstructed to greet the students with the “subdued clapping” appropriate\nto the gravity of the moment, but, when the first Stoneman Douglas\nstudents stepped off the bus, some couldn’t suppress a few whoops.\nAccompanied by ushers from the Leon student-government association, the\nleaders of the Never Again movement ascended the steps with the air of\nvisiting dignitaries, the other students following more bashfully behind\nthem, a few breaking into tears at the sight of the (now gently)\napplauding crowd that flanked the stairs.

(She had stayed in South Florida to organize.) The\nstudents had developed an attitude of greater aloofness with the", " reporters, the leaders in particular more adept at waving away\noutstretched microphones. The media horde was told to wait in the school\nlibrary while the travellers recovered in the cafeteria, and only then\nwere we given free rein to mingle, as the students ate pizza and candy\nand songs by Drake, Rihanna, and OneRepublic played through speakers.", "The students had been coördinating their visit with Lauren Book, a\nFlorida state senator who had, with the assistance of other state\nsenators and staff, helped them organize meetings with Florida state\nlegislators, as well as with the attorney general, Pam Bondi; and the\ngovernor, Rick Scott. Also roaming the cafeteria was Book’s father, Ron,\na bald and pugilistic-looking figure in a suit and tie, well known in\nFlorida for his forty-year career as a lobbyist. Lauren, who was\nwearing knee-high boots and a belted black dress with a pleated skirt,\nwelcomed the students, and Ron talked about how lucky he was to work\nwith his daughter. Then he hinted that the school shooting might offer a\ngood opportunity to advocate for limiting Florida’s open-records laws,\nunder which, he lamented, the addresses of the victims had been made\navailable to the public after the shooting. (I had yet to hear a student\nmention this as a point of contention.) Claire VanSusteren, a staffer of\nLauren Book’s, urged the students to be measured. Other students had\ntravelled to the capitol from Parkland in other caravans that day, and,\nVanSusteren said, had met with legislators and “started getting in their\nfaces and shooting with their cell phones,” resulting in cancelled\nmeetings. By the time that Kevin Rader, a state senator, said, “I know\nit’s kind of intimidating,” I wondered if any of the adults in the room\nhad noticed that what had gotten the students this far was not waiting\nfor permission or playing politics as usual but a coherent message\nabout gun control, the moral authority bestowed on them by tragedy and\nby their youth, and a refusal to conduct business as usual. Still, the\nstudents listened attentively.", "In the mazelike halls of the capitol building the next morning, a\nshoeshine man made his rounds; gentlemen rushed to open doors for the\nladies; and, while most of the legislators had the good sense to ignore\nthe posters advertising February 21st as “Seersucker Day,” at least one\nfull summer suit was worn in the chambers. The Florida state senate opened,\nas usual, with a prayer from the “chaplain of the day.” It was the first\nsenate session since the shooting, and the chaplain, a rabbi, prayed,\n“Please, God, help us illuminate the darkness caused by the extinguishing\nof seventeen lives.” After the Pledge of Allegiance, the lights were\ndimmed, and a silent slide show played with the names and photos of the\ndead, bringing some of the Stoneman Douglas students in the galleries to\ntears again.", "Jackie Corin sat in the front row of the balcony overlooking the\nchambers, next to her mother. Under Jackie’s leadership, the students\nhad formed ten groups of ten, which, throughout the morning, would travel\nto meet with different legislators. I joined the group that went to meet\nwith Rep. Alex Stark, of Broward County. Stark, a Democrat, agreed with\nthe students’ demands for changes to existing gun laws, and he did most of\nthe talking, reminiscing about the students who had organized to protest\nthe war in Vietnam, fifty years before. He took a question from a\nstudent, who asked, “What are you going to do for the students of\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas who have to go back to school?”", "“I don’t even have an answer for you,” Stark said. “We have schools in\nthe state that can’t afford student-resource officers,” he said,\nreferring to the armed police officers in schools. He turned the\ndiscussion to strengthening the Baker Act, which allows for the\ninvoluntary ", ". As to the possibility that the Florida legislature would pass meaningful reforms to existing gun\nlaws, he recalled a law known as the “Pop Tart bill,” which prohibits\ndisciplining students for playing with simulated weapons.\nGovernor Scott signed the bill into law in 2014, after a boy in\nMaryland was suspended for biting a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun.\n“This is what we’re dealing with here,” Stark said.", "By midday, at a planned press conference, a few of the students were\nshowing signs of impatience. The second speaker, ", ", whose spiky red hair stuck out in crowds, had not prepared anything to say.\nFortunately, he said, “I am the president and founder of the M.S.D.\nimprov club, so, hopefully, I can get something in.” He described being\namazed by his own classmates. “For the longest time, I’ve only perceived\nDouglas as just a school of entitled children and those who Juul,” he\nsaid, referring to a brand of electronic cigarettes. “Now I’m left\nseeing that these are powerful speakers.” What was disappointing to him\ntoday, he continued, had been the grownups. “The legislature, those in\npower, have not taken action. They’ve been using their words and using\npolitical double talk as much as they can, and it’s not a weapon that I\nwant them to be able to use anymore. They can walk around any question\nthey want, but the more they don’t act, the more they don’t deserve to be\nin office.” He", " pointed out that he was a senior, recently of legal\nvoting age. “I want to see those people who shot down that bill, who did\nnot let it get past committee,” he said. “I’m not here for a fight. I’m\nnot here to argue with you. I just want to speak. I just want to see\nyour face and know why.”", "The more time one spent in the state legislature, the more it seemed a\nplace of gestures and symbols, from the honorary plaques that lined the\nrepresentatives’ walls to the hand-sanitizer stations hung at regular\nintervals for post-handshake decontamination. The balconies of the\nrotunda, where the press conference was held, were adorned with Florida\nmiscellanea (“Orange state fruit,” “Orange Juice state beverage,” “Porpoise state saltwater mammal,”\n“Manatee state marine mammal”). As the students spoke, at a podium facing a line of\ncameras, legislators stood behind them wearing the same fixed smiles\nthat I had been seeing on the Olympic figure skaters on television in\nthe evenings. While some of the students felt satisfied that their\nvoices had been heard in the meetings, others spoke of cancelled\nappointments, and of one legislator arriving almost an hour late.\nGovernor Scott, however, kept his word to meet with the students,\nalthough he did so behind closed doors.", "At another meeting, a junior named Casey Sherman asked Manny Díaz, Jr.,\na Republican representative from Miami-Dade County, about the\npossibility of arming teachers. She worried it might put more student\nlives at risks, or that teachers could not be trusted “to handle the gun\nproperly and not harm themselves.” Díaz said that he was not talking\nabout teachers but, rather, “personnel that’s deputized and highly\ntrained,” he said. “Like an air marshal.” (The armed police officer\nassigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had stood outside the\nbuilding during the shooting, and has since resigned from his job.)", "Between meetings, the students were led to the House of Representatives\ngallery to pass the time. They watched as legislators passionately\ndiscussed House Bill 839, about the display of the state motto in\nschools; House Bill 7051, “An Act Relating to Trust Funds”; and a\nresolution to recognize Dominican-American Heritage Day. The audience\nwas asked to stand and applaud a legislator’s daughter who had made the\nmaroon remembrance ribbons that many of the lawmakers wore pinned to their\nlapels. As discussion turned to House Bill 7043, “Dredge and Fill\nPermitting Program,” I overheard Chris Grady lean over to Ryan Deitsch\nand whisper something. They stood up and left.", "Outside in the hall, the students vented. “This is a practice run,”\nDavid Hogg, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, said later. He had just flown\nin after making an appearance in Los Angeles on the “Dr. Phil” show. As\nwe spoke, he asked if we could go over to the balcony so he could lean\nagainst it. “If we can get this done at the federal level, this doesn’t\neven matter.” The torpor in Florida notwithstanding, the students had\nmanaged to force the agenda. By the end of the week, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and Governor Scott had suggested banning ", " and raising the age at which an adult can buy a gun, from eighteen to twenty-one. (Twenty-one is the national minimum age at which a person can buy a handgun but not an assault rifle.)", "Throughout the day, the students had been following on their phones the\ncourse of a massive protest being held outside the capitol building. In\nthe early afternoon, the rotunda slowly filled. Most of the protesters\nwere young, carrying signs that read “NRA Bribes < Student Lives,” “Kids > Guns,” and, simply, “Help.” They began yelling “Be ashamed,”\nthen “Vote them out,” then “Not one more.” Upstairs, several leaders of\nthe Never Again movement looked almost too tired to notice. Hogg\nreceived a phone call from NPR before his phone died. Ryan Deitsch and\nDelaney Tarr looked over the balcony with mild curiosity. Chris Grady\nsat alone on the bench of a piano pushed against the wall and stared\ninto space. In an hour, the leaders of Never Again, including Grady,\nHogg, and Tarr, would board a plane back to South Florida, where, later\nthat night, I watched them on television debating Senator Rubio and\nDana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A. The rest of the students would\nreturn home by bus. Classes would resume at Marjory Stoneman Douglas\nHigh School the following week.

This time, the U.S. and\nCanada both clobbered their semifinals opponents (Finland and the\n", ",\nrespectively) 5–0. Canada has beaten the U.S. the last three times\nthey’ve met, but the American team, which has a roster loaded with\ncollegiate stars, world champions, and returning Olympians, is not\nexactly a scrappy underdog. Even so, getting to Pyeongchang at all was\nnot a foregone conclusion for this team.", "Last March, the players of the U.S. women’s team ", " the chance to defend their world title, citing a year of fruitless negotiations with U.S.A. Hockey, the sport’s\ngoverning body, over wages and support. The World Championships were\nslated to be held on the Americans’ home turf, in Plymouth, Michigan,\nand the team had won six of the last eight world titles. “We are asking\nfor a living wage and for USA Hockey to fully support its programs for\nwomen and girls and stop treating us like an afterthought,” the team’s\ncaptain, Meghan Duggan, said in a statement at the time. “We have\nrepresented our country with dignity and deserve to be treated with\nfairness and respect.” U.S.A. Hockey provided the athletes with only a\nthousand dollars each month during the team’s six-month\nOlympic-residency period—many élite players, but not all, also receive\nstipends from the U.S. Olympic Committee—meaning that a team member’s\nmonthly pay from U.S.A. Hockey, after taxes, was barely enough to pay\nfor a pair of tickets to her own Olympic gold-medal match. (On Tuesday,\nthe cheapest remaining tickets were selling for nearly four hundred\ndollars each.) Between Olympics seasons, U.S.A. Hockey paid “virtually\nnothing,” lawyers for the players said. Roughly half of the team’s\nmembers hold second and even third jobs, and many others rely on\nfinancial support from family members. (As in\n", ",\nthe situation is entirely different for the men’s national team. For\ninstance, the men don’t share hotel rooms, as many of the female players\ndo. The men also, unlike the women, ", ".\nAccording to team handbooks, U.S.A.

An advisory group was formed to\nadvance girls’ and women’s hockey. Pay and benefits discrepancies\nweren’t the last bits of controversy to surround the women’s team,\nhowever. In September, as the team trained in Tampa, Florida, and\nHurricane Irma approached, an agent for the Winter Olympics wondered why\nU.S.A. Hockey was not evacuating the group. (By comparison, the Tampa\nBay Lightning, an N.H.L. team, chartered a flight to get a hundred and\nfifty people—players and members of their families—out of the area.) U.S.A. Hockey released a statement saying\nthat the team was not in an evacuation zone, and that plans were “in\nplace to move to an evacuation center if necessary.” Eventually, the\nteam did, in fact, have to leave Tampa and go to a shelter.", "“Indirectly, it ended up being a great team-bonding experience,” the\nforward ", ", after the team had spent nearly twenty-four hours in a shelter in Wesley\nChapel, Florida. “Hanging out together for that long, we still all got\nalong and it showed a lot about our team.” Duggan added that it was like\nhaving “a giant sleepover in a very secure area.” They passed the time,\nin part, by playing board games.", "That intimate team dynamic is something that not all female hockey\nplayers get to experience when they’re younger, when the best of them\noften play with boys and so do not share a locker room with their\nteammates. The defender Kacey Bellamy, from the age of eleven to\nthirteen, was among those who played on a boys’ team. “The locker room\nis such a sacred place for any athlete, especially [in] a team sport,\nand not being able to be there and prepare for a game—just small\ntalk—that’s probably the biggest thing for me,” she said about her time\nplaying with boys, when she felt “not really welcome.”", "Many of the players on the U.S. team also compete in the ", ", which is in its third\nseason and currently has four teams: the Buffalo Beauts, the Boston\nPride, the Connecticut Whale, and the Metropolitan Riveters (out of\nNewark, New Jersey).

Still, the fact of a women’s professional league\nis itself a mark of progress, and the league’s deputy commissioner,\nHayley Moore, told me that she is optimistic. “I don’t think there’s a\nbetter time for women’s hockey and fighting for equality,” she said.\n“There was obviously a huge spotlight shone on it, because of the\nboycott.

And, from a ratings perspective, a U.S.-Canada\ngold-medal rematch was probably the best possible outcome.", "It’s now been twenty years since the U.S. women’s team won its sole\nOlympic gold, at the first women’s tournament, in Nagano, in 1998. “I\nthink about this team and where we’ve come, our program, how far we’ve\ncome in the last four years, the last eight years,” Meghan Duggan told\nreporters in Pyeongchang before the competition. “We’ve seen tremendous\ngrowth. We’ve seen tremendous energy, excitement, and positivity. This\nis a different group. This is a different team than everyone saw four\nyears ago.

But there is enough vulnerability and brittle emotion in the\nOlympics without dragging family relationships into the mix. Having\nmissed out on the Sochi Games four years ago due to a knee injury, Vonn had been\nwaiting eight years for a chance to defend the gold medal in the\ndownhill, which she won in Vancouver. All those years came down, as\nthey often do in the Olympics, to less than half a second—the difference\nbetween triumph and the murkier result of the bronze medal. But, after\nthe race, Vonn was confronting more than the immediate result, and\nthinking about her career in broader terms. As has been well documented,\nshe has given her body to skiing—a broken arm, fractured knee, broken\nankle, torn A.C.L. and M.C.L., concussions. After each injury, she has\nwilled herself back into form, but, after the race on Wednesday, she\nsounded tired. Vonn has won more World Cup races than any other woman,\nand, at thirty-three, she has become the oldest woman to medal in an\nAlpine event. “I wish I could keep going,” she said. “My body just\ncan’t, probably can’t take another four years.”", "The hype machinery of the Olympics is good at building people up, but\ntraditionally has been less able to make sense of what happens when a\nfavorite loses.

And it doesn’t always work out.” Miller, who during his final\nOlympics four years ago, in Sochi, was also asked to talk on camera\nabout a death in his family, was being generous, and, based on his own\nexperience coming up short of expectations in the Olympics, insightful.\n“Athletes have a really hard time dealing with failure at this level,\nbecause they feel like they’ve let everyone else down,” he said, before\npraising Vonn’s willingness to put herself out there in front of the\nworld.

Attendance was underwhelming at first, with\nthousands of seats unfilled. As closing night drew near, the local\norganizing committee was uncertain about whether to extend the meetings.\nIt decided to ask God for a clear sign, like the one Gideon received in\nthe Old Testament.", "“It came at four-thirty the next morning,” Graham writes in his\nautobiography, “", ".” A jangling phone awoke Graham in his\nhotel room. On the other end was the popular entertainer Stuart Hamblen,\none of radio’s first singing cowboys, begging to meet. As Graham tells\nit, he dressed and met Hamblen and his wife. After they talked, Hamblen\n“gave his life to Christ in a child-like act of faith.” Graham said it\nwas then that he told the organizers that the crusade should go on.\nHamblen discussed his newfound faith on his radio program, and, during a\nsubsequent revival meeting, Graham was startled to find his tent\n“crawling with reporters and photographers.” Graham learned that the\npublishing giant William Randolph Hearst had issued an edict to all of\nthe editors in his newspaper chain: “Puff Graham.” The evangelist had\nnever met Hearst, but the magnate’s sons later told Graham that their\nfather had come to the revival, in disguise, with his mistress,\nMarion Davies. Attendance swelled, and an estimated three hundred and\nfifty thousand people eventually passed through the canvas cathedral, as\nit came to be called, in the course of eight weeks.", "The Los Angeles revival turned Graham into a national figure at a\nturning point in the history of American Protestantism. Religious\nleaders such as Harold Ockenga, the pastor of the Congregationalist Park\nStreet Church, in Boston, and Carl F. H. Henry, a theologian of Fuller\nTheological Seminary, outside Los Angeles, had become increasingly\ncritical of fundamentalism’s push to separate believers from society.\nBut they were also uncomfortable with the theological liberalism of\nchurch reformers who had embraced modernist thought. They sought to\nunite Protestant conservatives in a broader movement, New\nEvangelicalism, which they hoped would maintain a commitment to historic\nChristian tenets while actively engaging with the prevailing culture.\nGraham would become the leading figure in this movement, which went on\nto eclipse mainline Protestantism as the dominant force in American\nreligious life.", "Graham’s death, on Wednesday, at the age of ninety-nine, comes as that\nmovement is enduring fissures that have parallels to those that he and\nhis brethren sought to mend more than a half century ago. From the\nmid-nineteen-seventies through the mid-eighties, evangelicalism, led by\nthe Reverend Jerry Falwell, began its steady march rightward into the\nembrace of the Republican Party. The movement came to be defined by its\nsocial conservatism, though Graham himself tried to steer clear of\nissues like abortion. “I’m just going to preach the\ngospel and am not going to get off on all these hot-button issues,” he told ", ", in 2005. “If I get on these other subjects, it\ndivides the audience on an issue that is not the issue I’m promoting.\nI’m just promoting the gospel.”", "Other evangelical leaders, including Graham’s eldest son, Franklin, who\nhas inherited his father’s mantle as the leader of the Billy Graham\nEvangelistic Association, adopted a very different tack. Many\nevangelical leaders have been stalwart defenders of Donald Trump, even\nin the face of allegations of adultery, sexual assault, and harassment,\nbelieving they have found in him a staunch ally. “I believe Donald Trump\nis a good man,” Franklin Graham said on CNN, last month. “He did\neverything wrong as a candidate and he won, and I don’t understand it.\nOther than I think God put him there.” Last November, many of these same\nleaders ", " in his Senate bid in\nAlabama, despite allegations he had sexually assaulted teen-age girls.", "The result is a brewing existential crisis, particularly among younger\nbelievers, many of whom are choosing to shed the evangelical label.\nGraham and his cohort sought to forge a movement that was distinct from\nthe fundamentalism of their day, yet that is precisely what modern\nevangelicalism has come to be associated with. The overriding interest\nof Graham and other neo-evangelicals, as they were called, was in\nspurring a religious revival in the United States. That was why they\nsought to overcome the divisions that beset Protestants at the time. The\nquestion, today, is whether evangelicalism’s leaders remain primarily\ninterested in the spiritual, as Graham was, or if their agenda has\nbecome purely political. If it turns out to be the latter, that may well\nspell the end of the movement Graham helped forge."]},

Fred Guttenberg, a father whose fourteen-year-old daughter, Jaime, was one of seventeen people shot to death last Wednesday, fixed his gaze on one of his two U.S.  senators, Marco Rubio—a Republican with an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. Guttenberg said that Rubio’s comments about the shooting “and those of your President this week have been pathetically weak.” The audience erupted in furious agreement—an angry, standing ovation. Rubio—ashen, unmanned—had no response.", "Guttenberg continued, “So you and I are now eye to eye. Because I want to like you. Look at me and tell me. Guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week. And look at me and tell me you accept it and you will work with us to do something about guns.”", "Rubio might not have shown up at all. Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, did not, and he was mocked several times during the event for not having the courage to attend. (Chris W. Cox, a lobbyist for the N.R.A., has said of Scott, “Rick has signed more pro-gun bills into law in one term than any other governor in Florida history.”) For his part, Rubio—whom the N.R.A. applauds, on its Web site, for opposing “the Obama administration’s efforts to ban firearms, ammunition and magazines, as well as efforts to create a so-called ‘universal’ background check system”—probably figured that he could ease his way around the awkward moments, much as he does on the campaign trail.", "He was wrong. While Guttenberg stood waiting, blinking back at him, Rubio responded that the problem “cannot be solved by gun laws alone,” which is the kind of dodge that he and his colleagues routinely make in Washington. It is a phrase that carries the suggestion that, somehow, the question is too simple, too idealistic to be taken seriously. In Washington, where I live and work, reporters ask follow-up questions, of course, but the mood is often decorous and formulaic. This time, Rubio was encircled and out of his usual environment. The crowd jeered him. It whistled. Eventually, Rubio responded that he would support laws raising the minimum age for buying a rifle and banning bump stocks, and said that he was open to discussing limiting large-capacity magazines.

He asked Rubio, “Would you refuse to accept donations from the National Rifle Association in the future?”", "Rubio, hesitating, settled, eventually, on the idea that he would continue to accept N.R.A. funds because, he said, “people buy into my agenda, and I do support the Second Amendment.” The crowd booed. He added, “I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda”—a comment so bland and euphemistic that it only dramatized the corrupt aroma surrounding money, guns, and politics. Under stress, Rubio tends to repeat himself, and he cycled through his talking point—“people buy into my agenda”—in a way that was reminiscent of his downfall in the 2016 Presidential race, when Chris Christie mocked him and his repetitive platitudes onstage, effectively ending Rubio’s campaign.", "As a moment in American politics, the pummelling of Rubio felt like an expression of collective rage at the falseness of so much that happens in Washington: the pivot, the dodge, the pallid follow-up question. Authenticity has rarely been more sought after in our public life—and, at once, so elusive. Accountability—the knowledge that the men and women we elect will act, foremost, in our interest and not that of their donors—has become a civic myth. Until a week ago, the students and parents of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School never intended to be part of politics in this way, so they reject its pieties and rhythms. In several minutes on a weeknight, they laid bare Rubio’s central political flaw—inauthenticity—more vividly than I ever could in a magazine profile.", "It was easy to watch the town hall and wonder if this will be an inflection point in America’s broken politics regarding guns—a moment when the force of money and political organization will actually be overwhelmed by the public desire to end the slaughter in American schools. But it is naïve to assume that it will necessarily be different this time; those choices are ahead, not behind. A genuine clash over the politics of guns—a challenge from the public to the men and women who serve in their name—might have gained new clarity on live television. But, for the moment to matter to history, that urgency will need to endure long after the cameras have been turned off."]},

Graham, who possessed an incandescent charm,\npaired with a snow-white smile and eyes of the bluest blue, helped to\nbring millions, arguably tens of millions, of believers into the fold of\na particularly effervescent form of Christianity. This began in the\nnineteen-fifties, as an American effort, but quickly sparked a global\npush to reach souls in Africa, Asia, and South America, where his\npreaching helped birth the popular evangelical movement.", "Graham’s world view centered on the basic and absolute tenet that human\nbeings were either damned or saved. Each of us was hurtling toward Hell\nor Heaven, and there was only one way to enter the latter: through the\nbelief in Jesus Christ as our personal lord and savior. For\nevangelicals, this credo is exemplified by the Gospel of John 14:6, in\nwhich Jesus says to his followers, “I am the way, the truth, and the\nlife: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”", "“There is no middle ground,” Billy’s son, Franklin Graham, told me in\nKhartoum, in 2003, after quoting that passage. Franklin, the heir to his\nfather’s empire, with three hundred and ninety-four million dollars in\nassets, and an informal adviser to President Trump, is well known for\nhis comments about Islam (a “wicked and evil” religion) and for deeming\nTrump’s Muslim ban “not a Bible issue.” There are often echoes of the\nyounger Graham in Trump’s attempts to enlist the evangelical voting\nbloc, which has largely come to represent a conservative activism that\npits itself against the progressive agenda, on issues ranging from\ngay-wedding cakes to transgender bathroom use.", "But such stances were anathema to Billy Graham. A vocal opponent of\nsegregation, Graham fought against cultural strictures and made room for\na broad swath of political and religious views. Throughout the\nnineteen-fifties, he pushed for an agenda that was often as inclusive as\nthat of the political left. He refused to segregate his crusades, and\nbecame friends with Martin Luther King, Jr., who asked that Graham call him by his childhood name, Mike. King\ncredited part of his success to Graham’s support, public and private; as\na result, the K.K.K. targeted Graham.", "Graham also took on what was, at the time, the most feared religion in\nAmerica: Catholicism. “When ", " was still writing about the\nthreat of Catholics in American politics in the nineteen-fifties, Billy\nGraham was reaching out to them,” Tim Shah, a scholar of religion and\npolitics with Georgetown’s Religious Freedom Research Project, told me.\nGraham was initially concerned about the election of John F. Kennedy,\nbut he developed a good rapport with the President. He also had a strong\necumenical relationship with Pope John Paul II, who called Graham his\nbrother. The preacher had a less fortunate experience with Richard\nNixon. As Nixon’s personal pastor, Graham grew close to the President,\nand was chastened after Nixon’s illegal actions were exposed. He claimed\nthat listening to the Watergate tapes made him physically ill.", "Graham maintained that homosexuality was an “insidious temptation,” and was plagued, in his later years, by comments he had made to Nixon about a Jewish “stranglehold” on American media. (He apologized for the conversation, which was recorded on tape.) But he was generally muted about political issues, and by the nineteen-seventies his broader push for social action had only strengthened. “He was the middle on a whole host of things,” Shah said. “He gave permission to evangelical Christians around the world to be globally minded and engaged.” Along with John Stott, the British theologian, Graham shifted the movement’s focus from saving souls to practicing social justice. In 1974, he and\nStott convened a group of evangelical leaders in Lausanne, Switzerland,\nwhere they drafted a manifesto that called for ", ".\nThe text read, in part:", "This was a radical call for evangelicals to reconcile with modernity,\nand it came from Graham, the undisputed leader of the global movement.\nToday, that call is often lost in a landscape where the loudest\nevangelical preachers encourage division and exclusion. There are\nimportant exceptions—Timothy Keller, Rick Warren—and, at least on\nChristian college campuses, political divisions don’t break down so\nneatly. (There were protests at Liberty University when Jerry Falwell,\nJr., endorsed Trump, and students like those who participated often see\nexcuses for the President—he’s a “baby Christian,” for instance—as\nhypocrisy.) But the evangelical movement has fractured, and, although\ncharacters such as Falwell, Jr., and Franklin Graham may be highly\nvisible, especially when praying at Trump’s Inauguration, the truth is\nthat no evangelical leader comes close to wielding the power or moral\nauthority that Billy Graham once did.", "The question remains: What happened to Graham’s movement, and where did\nthe evangelical middle go? The answer may lie partly in the events of\nSeptember 11, 2001. Although evangelicals battled the evils of Communism\nduring the Cold", " War, the global turn against Islam, which has roots in\nthe evangelical movement’s thinking at the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, has been unprecedented in its scope. Both 9/11 and the\nsubsequent culture wars have driven evangelical politics toward a\nhard-edged political activism that runs counter to Billy Graham’s life\nand work. He will be missed."]},

Yes! Yes! Yes! Gold!” he screamed, as Diggins’s\nski touched the line just ahead of that of her competitor from Sweden.\nDiggins collapsed to the ground, and her teammate Kikkan Randall\njumped on top of her—while the play-by-play announcer Steve Schlanger,\nalso miles from South Korea, exclaimed that it was the first-ever gold\nmedal in cross-country skiing for the United States. It was perhaps the\nmost thrilling moment for an American athlete in these Olympics, made\nmore so by Schlanger’s excitement and Salmela’s ecstasy.", "Not every Olympic moment is so groundbreaking, or deserving of such\nexultant commentary. On the other end of the announcing spectrum in\nPyeongchang is the former Olympic skier Bode Miller, who, with the\nveteran play-by-play man Dan Hicks, has been calling the Alpine skiing\nevents for NBC on location. Miller, who retired last year, is calling\nhis first Olympics, and his subdued style has been polarizing. Many have\npraised his relaxed and knowledgeable commentary, in which he has helped\nto make sense of the small details that often decide the outcome of a\nrace. Others, making up a louder chorus, have been decidedly less\nimpressed. Miller began the Olympics on the wrong foot when he\nsuggested, in an offhand comment, that the Austrian skier Anna Veith had\nbeen struggling because she had recently got married.

It didn’t help that the biggest skiing\nsurprise of the Games—the win in the super-G by Ester Ledecká, of the\nCzech Republic, who is better known as a snowboarder—happened after NBC\nhad declared another skier the winner and had taken coverage of the event\noff the air for the night.", "Miller’s laconic manner is\ncertainly unusual, and serves as a counterweight to the Scott Hamilton\nor Rowdy Gaines school of unfettered Olympic enthusiasm, in which\neverything that is happening—figure skaters jumping, swimmers\nswimming—seems to be unprecedented and amazing. For these Olympics,\nMiller replaced Todd Brooker, a former Canadian skier, who speaks faster\nand at a higher pitch. That gave Brooker’s commentary more urgency—but\nhis constant energy created its own feeling of flatness. (Plenty of\npeople also complain when announcers are too excitable, as when Tony\nRomo was mocked during the N.F.L. playoffs for his giddiness.) And what\nMiller has lacked in expressiveness he has made up for by speaking with\nempathy and insight about the practical and emotional pressures facing\nthe skiers. He’s also been amusingly contrarian, as when, on Wednesday’s\nbroadcast, he threw a bit of cold water on one of NBC’s big dramatic\nnarratives by saying that he wasn’t entirely convinced that ", " was really retiring from the Olympics, despite her statement that this\nwould be her final Games.", "The divided opinion on Miller\nmight speak more generally to what viewers want from the Olympics—and\nthe difference between watching the Games as a casual spectator and\nbeing an expert. When the viewer sees athletes hurtling down\nthe mountain at dangerous speeds, protected only by helmets and a thin\nlayer of spandex, thwacking into gates and narrowly avoiding falls,\nMiller sees the performance of ski waxes, the small particulars of edge\ncontrol, and the slight changes in line that set the winners apart. He\nhas seen a lot of skiing, and his general attitude is that most of it is\nnot worth screaming about."]},

Leveraging a statewide network of activists built\nover the preceding decade and funded by Michael Bloomberg and other\nnational gun-control advocates, Democrats passed the gun-control\nmeasures when they controlled Colorado’s governorship and the state\nlegislature. But they did not anticipate the backlash\nthat allowed Republicans to win control of the state Senate by ousting\ntwo Democratic state senators in recall votes and winning a third seat\nafter a Democrat resigned.", "The governor, John Hickenlooper, a brewpub owner turned\npolitician, said in an interview this week that after the Aurora\nshooting he thought he could foster a bipartisan consensus regarding\nuniversal background checks. He recalled having cordial conversations\nabout gun laws with Second Amendment experts and Republican donors\nheading into the 2013 legislative session. “Every single Republican I\ntalked to supported universal background checks,” Hickenlooper said. “So, in my naïveté, I thought it would whiz right\nthrough.”", "As the bills moved through the legislative process, hundreds of gun\nowners clogged the halls of the capitol.

(The company\nfollowed through, relocating and moving roughly a hundred jobs to\nCheyenne, Wyoming, in 2015.) Several of Colorado’s sheriffs, mostly from\nrural counties, later sued the state in an effort to overturn the new\nlaws. The lawsuits failed, but the N.R.A. and local gun-rights groups persist in their yearly efforts to reverse\nthe laws.", "Will Coyne, one of two lobbyists hired by Bloomberg’s organization\nMayors Against Illegal Guns, described 2013 as a year-long political\nepiphany. “I realized I did not fully understand politics in America,\nand how intrinsically the segment of society that cares about gun\nrights, how deeply they believe that, how much gun rights are wrapped up\nin their political and cultural identity,” he said.", "John Morse, a former Colorado Springs-area police chief who passed the\nmeasures when he served as the president of the Colorado state Senate,\npaid the heaviest political price. Although Morse expresses no regrets, he said his recall after the gun-safety measures passed\ncreated an excuse for other Democrats not to act. “We beat the N.R.A. in\nColorado, and then what happened was they beat us,” he said. “They rode\nme out of town on a rail, and now there’s not a Democrat in the country\nthat has the stomach to do what needs to be done.”", "Coyne praised Morse, saying “he pushed as far as he possibly could, and\nhe did it because he thought it was the right thing to do, and he did it\nwithout fear of consequence. In my career, I’ve never seen another\npolitician act like that.”", "Democrats also initially underestimated the intensity of support for some gun-control initiatives on their own side. The\nmagazine ban gathered steam when Hickenlooper, known for his political\ncaution, unexpectedly got behind it. “It was tangible in a way\nbackground checks weren’t,” Coyne, the lobbyist, told me. “People could\nhold the magazines and see the difference in size. It actually\ngalvanized our side in a way we hadn’t expected, and it gave us more\nmomentum.”", "Gun-rights advocates, meanwhile, seized on the legislative battle to boost their own membership rolls and organize\nprotests (including a day when gun owners circled the capitol\nin cars while honking their horns). Hickenlooper contends that as mass\nshootings continue to occur, broader public frustration will grow. With\nsignificant federal reforms unlikely, he predicted that more states will\neventually enact reforms similar to Colorado’s.  “I think those folks, the people that really thought that this was too great a cost to\npay—now history", " says, if anything, we should have pushed a little further,” Hickenlooper said. “While I’m sure there are things in the process we could have\nchanged or improved, I don’t have any anxiety or self-doubt that what we did was important and right.”", "A ", " released this week found that sixty-six per cent of American voters supported stricter gun control laws, a fourteen per cent increase since 2015.

A liberal Democrat with a law degree and a debater’s temperament, he was seen in New York as “a garrulously intelligent, wonkish politician whose previous claims to fame” included “fighting against Donald Trump’s projects on the West Side,” as the ", " noted, in a 1999 profile. When House Republicans impeached Bill Clinton, in 1998, for lying about his affair with the former intern Monica Lewinsky, Nadler emerged as one of Clinton’s most ardent and public defenders, trading his obscurity for a brief moment in the national spotlight. The impeachment, he warned in the House Judiciary Committee, was a spectacular misuse of the power granted to Congress by its founding fathers, a “partisan coup d’état.”", "Twenty years later, history has intervened to give Nadler another shot at Trump. And, this time, Nadler’s own party is clamoring for impeachment. Nadler’s chance came in December, in one of those little-noticed internal congressional maneuvers that can often have big political consequences months or even years later. The #MeToo movement had just claimed the eighty-eight-year-old congressman John Conyers, of Michigan, who resigned after multiple women came forward to accuse him of harassing and propositioning them. That left a prime opening to succeed Conyers as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee an impeachment of Trump if Democrats were to win control of the House in November’s midterm elections.", "Nadler quickly made the case to fellow-Democrats that he was the perfect marriage of man and moment: a Trump “archenemy,” as one New York paper called him back in the nineties, familiar both with the President’s Manhattan business machinations and the nuances of constitutional law that would become relevant if the Judiciary Committee tried to impeach Trump. Nadler didn’t say so publicly, but his campaign pitch against Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat best known for her work on immigration, was all about the politically charged I-word; a leaflet he wrote and handed out to Democratic members said he was “the strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.”", "In an impassioned closed-door speech to the Democratic caucus before the vote, Nadler told his colleagues that Trump had put the country “on the brink of a constitutional crisis.” The Democrats voted, 118–72, to give Nadler the job, setting him up to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee if they take back the House. Impeachment, a liberal pipe dream a year ago, would almost certainly become the committee’s top priority, and the road to it would run right through Nadler, a stubborn seventy-year-old who spent the better part of two decades battling to stop Trump from rerouting the West Side Highway. History may not repeat but it does have a sense of humor.", "Nadler clearly relishes the thought of taking Trump on once again, and, if and when it comes to impeachment, he will in no way be a neutral arbiter of the President’s fate but an implacable foe who has already pronounced judgment on Trump’s fitness for office. After Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James Comey, last spring, Nadler said that there was a “very strong case” that it constituted obstruction of justice. He opened a recent town-hall meeting with constituents by saying, “This President presents the greatest threat to constitutional liberty and the functioning of our government in living memory.”", "Over the course of two recent conversations with me, Nadler was just as scathing regarding Trump. The indictment of thirteen Russians by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, on charges of manipulating the 2016 U.S. election had just been released, and Nadler said he believed that Trump’s refusal to retaliate for the Russian intervention was as serious as if an American Commander-in-Chief had failed to respond to the 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. “It’s a fundamental attack on our way of life. It’s a very fundamental attack on the U.S. And it has to be taken seriously, and Trump is not doing his job,” Nadler said. “What if Roosevelt had said, after Pearl Harbor, ‘We’re not sure who did it. Maybe it was the Chinese. Maybe it was somebody else’? And used that as an excuse not to respond?”", "So, I asked, is that an impeachable offense? “Potentially,” he answered. “He is not carrying out his duties.” Then again, Nadler added, “Impeachment is a political act, and you have to make a lot of judgments. Is it an impeachable offense if he persists in not doing his office? Yeah, I’d say it is. But just because it’s an impeachable offense does not mean he should be impeached. It’s a different judgment.”", "A vocal and growing minority of House Democrats is not waiting for the results of Mueller’s investigation to make that judgment on impeaching Trump. Among Nadler’s colleagues, a resolution to begin the process of impeachment authored by Congressman Al Green, of Texas, has twice been put to a vote. In early December, it received fifty-eight Democratic votes. By mid-January, it was up to sixty-six votes, still far from the two hundred and eighteen needed for a House majority. Public support for such a move is higher. In a recent national poll, about forty-one per cent of Americans support impeachment, significantly", " more than the twenty-six per cent who backed such proceedings against Richard Nixon at the start of the Watergate hearings, which eventually led to Nixon’s downfall.", "Watergate revivalism, in fact, is booming among a certain cohort of Trump-loathing liberals, and a smart Slate podcast called “", "” that excavated the history of Watergate for the millennial generation shot to the top of the Apple charts. When I recently appeared on a panel with Watergate veterans convened by Slate at the Watergate Hotel, there was a sold-out audience of several hundred who had shelled out twenty dollars a pop to listen to the reminiscences of the talk-show host Dick Cavett, the Nixon biographer Evan Thomas, and the journalist Elizabeth Drew, who chronicled the Nixon impeachment proceedings for this magazine. The Trump era, short as it is, has already spawned its own literature of impeachment to add to the Watergate shelves, including “The Case for Impeachment,” a best-seller by the American University professor Allan Lichtman, and “Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide,” by the Harvard professor Cass Sunstein, a former adviser to President Obama.", "There is also an active and increasingly loud impeachment lobby led by the billionaire activist Tom Steyer, a San Francisco businessman who has already spent more than thirty million dollars on a public campaign calling for Congress to remove Trump from office. Since launching in October, his group, Need to Impeach, has acquired close to five million online signatures for its impeachment petition. TV ads feature Steyer looking into the camera, with the White House in the background, recounting a varied litany of complaints about Trump. An early ad said, “Donald Trump has brought us to the brink of nuclear war, obstructed justice, and taken money from foreign governments. We need to impeach this dangerous President.” A more current version reels off the indictments already obtained by Mueller’s investigators and concludes, “No President is above the law.”", "When we spoke last week, Steyer seemed almost agnostic about the official reasons Congress should cite for Trump’s impeachment. He told me he was convinced that new and compelling evidence would emerge to bolster the political case for removing the President from office. Steyer said that he felt no need to wait for the results of Mueller’s investigation and was responding to the political reality that it can take a long time, as it did during Watergate, to get the American people to accept the radical step of removing a President from office. “We started this knowing it’s a marathon and not a sprint,” Steyer told me. “And that it has to do with the information reaching the American people so that people understand this is a deeply unfit and dangerous American President.”", "But Steyer’s rallying of the Trump-hating party base has put him at odds with Nadler and other Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, who believe it is both premature and politically damaging to call for impeachment now. The House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, a fellow-Californian, called Steyer—a huge party benefactor, who contributed more than sixty million dollars to the Party’s candidates and causes in 2016—to lobby him directly against the impeachment drive, the ", " reported. Bernie Sanders has publicly pleaded with Steyer and others to avoid “jumping the gun” and pushing for Trump’s removal before it’s possible to achieve it. Other Democrats, especially the campaign strategists who have to advise the Party’s candidates in the midterm elections, fear that impeachment is a political loser with voters, who will cast ballots on more traditional pocketbook issues.", "Steyer is well aware of the criticism. He said he knew that the numbers in Congress, for now, are against him. “How that works out, exactly, I don’t know,” he told me. “But I would also quote Nelson Mandela: ‘Everything is impossible until it happens.’ We are saying something that is incredibly important to the people of the United States. We understand there’s a concern that it does not suit the short-term needs of some elected officials. I understand that they’ve got to try and figure that out.”", "Jerry Nadler is still figuring it out. “My view of impeachment is to be very careful about impeachment,” he told me. Since succeeding Conyers in the House Judiciary Committee post, he’s been raising his profile, appearing as a talking head on MSNBC and CNN, attacking Trump, and talking as though the President is a genuine menace to the nation. But that doesn’t mean Nadler is ready to call for impeachment, at least not yet. He considers Steyer’s Need to Impeach campaign “premature at best,” he told me. “I don’t think it’s constructive. We don’t have the evidence now that would be convincing enough to people to justify impeachment.” As a political matter, Nadler added, “I don’t think the election campaign should be fought on the basis of impeachment or no impeachment. We’ve got plenty of problems in the country, and I don’t think it helps the country, never mind the Democrats. We should, though, fight the election on the grounds of whether the President is a good or a terrible President.”", "Nadler comes from a safely Democratic district and has never had a competitive race since he first won his seat, in a special election, in 1992. But political calculation dominated our conversations about whether and how the impeachment of Trump could proceed. In Nadler’s reading of history, Nixon was forced from office because Democrats enlisted enough", " Republicans in the impeachment case to make Nixon’s presumed conviction in the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, likely; then and only then did Nixon step aside. In the Clinton case, conversely, Democrats stuck together and voted en masse against the House impeachment, and Republicans were unable to secure a conviction on the basis of just their own party’s votes in the Senate. Nadler warned of a “partisan coup d’état” against Clinton on the House floor, but, in the end, the political math didn't favor it.", "The Clinton impeachment shapes how Nadler views a prospective case against Trump. “I said this on the floor of the House in 1998, and I meant it: impeachment must not be partisan,” Nadler told me. “And that’s true for two reasons. Number one, simple arithmetic. Let’s assume the Democrats get a majority of the House in the election, and let’s assume you vote impeachment on a partisan basis: all the Democrats voted for it; all the Republicans voted against it. Yes, you could impeach the President in the House. But you need a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and what’s the point of it? If you’re going to impeach him, you ought to be pretty sure you can convict him and remove him from office, and you should have good reasons for doing so.”", "Removing the President is a dramatic move against the popular will; in effect, Nadler said, “you are nullifying the last election,” which is not something to be undertaken “without having buy-in, at least by the end of the process, by an appreciable fraction” of Republicans as well as Democrats. The alternative? “Twenty or thirty years of recriminations. Of almost half the country saying, ‘We won the election; you stole it from us.’ You don’t want to do that. Which means you should not impeach the President unless you really believe that, by the end of the process, you will have not only Democrats agreeing with you but a good fraction of the people who voted for him.”", "There’s also the matter of evidence, and just what the charges would be against Trump. In the Clinton case, Nadler argued that Presidential perjury about a sexual affair did not rise to the level of impropriety envisioned in the Constitution, and he successfully urged Republicans on the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on just what would constitute an impeachable offense, an exercise that convinced him that “the real test for an impeachable offense is, is this a threat to the constitutional order, to the protection of liberty, to the checks and balances system that the Constitution sets up?” He told me, “The impeachment clause was put into the Constitution as a political tool with which to defend the republic, to defend the constitutional order, to defend against a would-be tyrant.”", "Those are strong words, and I found myself wondering whether Nadler really expected the case against Trump to rise someday to the grave standard he was setting for it. Does he think Trump is a tyrant, or that he could become one? Our back-and-forth on the matter left me feeling unclear, though it is certainly conventional wisdom in both parties these days that Democrats, given the House majority, are all but certain to proceed with some kind of case against Trump. (“This impeachment threat is out there,” a Fox News commentator named Liz Peek warned the crowd at last week’s ", ", the annual conference for conservatives, according to the Washington ", ". “It’s a very good reason to go vote, and to give money.”)", "Still, Nadler insisted to me that he was not prepared to go forward with impeachment just because angry Democrats demand it, or even because he viewed Trump as unfit for office. “You don’t decide to impeach the President for the hell of it,” he told me. In dealing with Trump, Nadler said he expected that Mueller, like previous special counsels before him in the Clinton and Nixon cases, would deliver a report to Congress laying out his evidence related to the President, and he promised it would have to be sufficiently serious and specific. “To initiate impeachment, we would have to be convinced—I would certainly have to be convinced if I were going to help lead it—that the President has committed impeachable offenses, and that those impeachable offenses are so serious that the constitutional order is threatened if he is not impeached and removed from office,” Nadler said. “That’s the real test.”", "I asked whether Trump’s firing of Comey obstructed the F.B.I. investigation into possible Trump-campaign collusion with Russia. Would that meet the standard for an impeachable offense? At first, Nadler demurred, saying he was “not a judge and not a jury right now.” But he signalled that his stance could change. Nadler added, tantalizingly, that he had consulted both public evidence and still-secret documents. “It may be that you can make a very serious case against the President,” he told me. “And I stress the word ‘may be.’ ”"]},

I interviewed the “jail without bail” students\nafter their arrests and submitted their stories to Julian Bond, the\npaper’s managing editor and one of the authors of the Committee’s\nmanifesto, who later became an outspoken champion of civil rights in\nCongress and chair of the N.A.A.C.P. This was the beginning of my life\nas a journalist.", "As I looked out at the crowd during my lecture, I was proud to be\nsurrounded by black, white, Latino, and Asian students, an image that\nHamilton never knew. He died at the age of fifty-four, and I can’t help\nbut think that the stress of all we went through contributed to his\nuntimely passing. He had been a football star at Turner High School, in\nAtlanta, and wanted so badly to play with the U.G.A. Bulldogs after our\nadmission. He was denied the chance to join the team on the grounds\nthat, if his white teammates didn’t hurt him on the field, players from\nother, still-segregated schools would. It was a devastating blow, but\nHamp concentrated on his studies. He graduated, went to Emory\nUniversity—as that institution’s first black medical student—and became\nan orthopedic surgeon.", "A few nights after the lecture, in another state, I attended a “Black\nPanther” première with Don Harris, a retired businessman who was a\ncivil-rights activist in the South in the sixties. Before the movie\nbegan, we talked about the news of the day: ", ", and the subsequent plan, by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, to march on government offices and demand\ncommonsense gun-control laws that could prevent another slaughter.", "My friend is as gray as those who travelled to Athens* for the lecture. In our conversation, he said\nhe was sad about the murders but also encouraged by what he was hearing\nof the plans of students, from Florida and other parts of the\ncountry, to head to Washington and make their demands for better gun\nrestrictions heard. “That’s how it started for us—it was students, from\nall across the South,” he said. “And look what we achieved.” We were\nteen-agers when we took on the racist Jim Crow laws of the South. Some\nadults were afraid for us, and some didn’t agree with our protests, but\nwe all felt the sting of segregation. Such history holds lessons for the\nyoung people who are marching and standing up", " today. As Don sat down in\nthe dark, and as the previews began to roll, he whispered to me, “It’s\nnow their time. And, given our history, I am hopeful they will succeed.”", "*"]},

But, in terms of frequency and of the almost\njoyful abandonment of integrity as a demand of the office, Donald Trump\nis singular. He starts lying in the morning, tweeting while watching Fox\nNews, and he keeps at it until his head hits the pillow at night. He\nlies to slander and seduce, he lies to profit, and he sometimes lies, it\nseems, just because. His capacity for falsehood is so heroic that we\nstruggle to keep count of the daily instances. (After one year of the\nTrump Presidency, the Washington ", " put the average at 5.9\nfalsehoods per day, a total of 2,140.) One consequence of this aspect of\nTrump’s character—oftentimes, it seems to be the very core of his\ncharacter—is that lying defines the culture of his Administration just\nas it did his family business.", "Hope Hicks has now announced that she is resigning as Trump’s\ncommunications director. This comes just one day after she told the\nHouse Intelligence Committee, in a nine-hour closed-door session, that\nshe was occasionally given to telling “white lies.” In the moral\nuniverse of the Trump White House, her sin could not have been the\nlying; it could only be the admission.", "Michael Flynn. Paul Manafort. Sean Spicer. Anthony Scaramucci. Steve\nBannon. Sebastian Gorka. Omarosa Manigault-Newman. Next to these\nnow-departed characters, Hope Hicks was a decidedly recessive cast\nmember, almost a cipher by her own design. She was known among White\nHouse reporters to answer calls, texts, and e-mails––a courtesy that is\nhardly a universal in politics––though she almost never allowed herself\nto be quoted. When she appeared on television, it was inadvertent, as if\nshe had mistakenly stepped into the frame. When she was written about,\nreporters invariably leaned on stock phrases about her appearance, her\noutfits, her loyalty and access to Trump, her ability to read his moods,\nher stint as a model, and her upbringing in Greenwich, Connecticut. As a\ncommunications director, she was, when it came to the subject of Hope\nHicks, uncommunicative. The words she used to describe her feelings upon\nresigning were that she had “no words.”", "Hicks, however, is kidding herself if she thinks that her tenure will be\njudged only for harmless, situational untruths. The white lie is a\nphrase that goes back to the sixteenth century, at least. “Shakespeare’s\nWorld,” a collaboration between the Oxford English Dictionary and the\nFolger Shakespeare Library, reports that, in 1567, one Ralph Adderly\nwrote of his brother-in-law, “I do assure you he is unsuspected of any\nuntruth or other notable crime (except a white lie) which is taken for a\nSmall fault in these parts.”", "The President’s daily communications are a tangle of falsehoods,\ndefamations, and tall tales, and Hicks was his facilitator, his\ndefender, his explainer. That line of work goes far beyond the scope of\n“white lies.” Sissela Bok, in “Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private\nLife,” writes that white lies are “the most common and the most trivial\nforms that duplicity can take.” They are lies “not meant to injure\nanyone.”", "The Administration’s penchant for deception is injurious in many ways,\nnot least because it devalues truth as a value in public discourse. Like\nSean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Hicks, even\nin her camera- and microphone-shy way, spent years being loyal to Trump\nand his mendacities. She was always prepared to do his bidding,\nincluding when there was an ugliness to the bidding: She pushed back\nhard against the Pope when he dared to criticize the President’s hopes\nto wall off Mexico. She cast her lot with him and stayed with him as the\ninjuries he inflicted multiplied. A well-reported Politico profile of\nHicks portrayed her loyalty as eerily absolute: “Colleagues described\nHicks as someone who communicates with Trump in a similar way to his\ndaughter Ivanka––she can express her disagreements to the president\nprivately, but ultimately supports his decisions unquestioningly.”", "It is not entirely clear why Hicks is resigning. Maggie Haberman, of the ", ", tweeted that the “white lies” moment was not the reason. It could be that Hicks is just worn out from being by Trump’s side for nearly three years. She\nhardly distinguished herself while trying to cover for Rob Porter, a\nformer White House aide whose two ex-wives accused him of assault. She\nis said to have been involved romantically with Porter.", "Perhaps we will hear from Hope Hicks in a more unguarded way in the\nfuture. The pattern has been that, once these aides lose their White\nHouse passes and get some distance from the tumult of Pennsylvania\nAvenue, they begin to reveal their sense of despair about the place, if\nnot their shame. Everyone hates everyone; everyone has it out for the\nrest. Just today the President tweeted that his Attorney General was\n“disgraceful.” “Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by fifty,”\nReince Priebus is quoted as saying in a new chapter of “The\nGatekeepers,” a book on White House chiefs of staff, by Chris Whipple.", "Trump has created a poisonous culture in his Administration that is not\nonly doing great damage to the country but is also destroying itself.\n", ",\nhis son-in-law and senior adviser,", " is known by foreign leaders to be so\nhungry for business and open to influence that he’s been denied the\nsecurity clearances that a President’s emissary would need. Now the\n", " has revealed that he has taken tens of millions of dollars in\n", " from financial interests that only recently came to do White House\nbusiness with him.", "The Oval Office used to be described as a chaotic “Grand Central\nStation,” mobbed with warring satraps hustling for the President’s\nfleeting attentions. One after another, they have headed for, or they\nhave been shown, the door. Perhaps Hope Hicks will retain her sense of\ndiscretion long after she leaves the White House. In any case, it is\nhard to agree that her deceptions were merely occasional or, as she put\nit to the House members, “white lies”; the self-deception required to\nserve Donald Trump with such unquestioning devotion, to be his voice,\nknowing what she must know, has proved anything but harmless."]},

Compared to her predecessors, Nielsen’s\nrésumé is conspicuously thin. Prior to joining the Trump Administration,\nshe was a little-known cybersecurity consultant with no major management\nexperience. “In a normal Administration, there isn’t a chance in hell\nshe would get nominated for anything above an undersecretary job,” a\nformer national-security official, who served under George W. Bush, told\nme.", "Over her first three months in the job, Nielsen has showcased her\nloyalty to the White House that elevated her. In early January, she\ncancelled the status of two hundred thousand Salvadorans who’ve lived\nlegally in the U.S since 2001. A week later, in sworn testimony, she\ntold members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that she couldn’t recall\nwhether the President had used the word “shitholes” to describe African\ncountries during an Oval Office meeting on immigration. Then, in\nFebruary, Nielsen issued a series of aggressive statements criticizing\nbipartisan immigration bills that appeared to be gaining support in the\nSenate. One of the proposals, according to D.H.S., “would effectively\nmake the United States a Sanctuary Nation where ignoring the rule of law\nis encouraged.” Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican,\ncomplained, “It sounded like something that came from a political hack,\nnot D.H.S.”", "I recently spoke to seven current and former officials at D.H.S. to\nunderstand what’s been driving Nielsen. All of them described her as\nmore of an opportunist than an ideologue. She rose through the ranks of\nthe department because she positioned herself close to key figures in\nthe White House, the officials told me; each of them characterized\nNielsen as a close ally of John Kelly, the White House chief of staff.\nThe tough stance she has adopted on immigration is largely an extension\nof his. To improve her standing with the President, Nielsen coöperated\nwith a cadre of White House staffers, led by Stephen Miller, the\nPresident’s senior adviser, who see D.H.S. as a tool to advance their\nhard-line agenda on immigration. The officials I spoke with conceded\nthat the alternatives to Nielsen’s nomination could have been more\nextreme. But Nielsen, in their view, posed a special problem: because\nshe was so pliant and inexperienced, they said, she risked turning\nD.H.S. into an overt political pawn of the Trump White House.", "Nielsen joined the Trump Administration in January, 2017, when she began\nserving as John Kelly’s chief of staff at the Department of Homeland\nSecurity. Her role was controversial from the start. After Kelly was\ntapped to lead D.H.S., he ", ", Jeh Johnson,  and chose a seasoned department hand, a former Air Force colonel named\nAlan Metzler, as his chief of staff. But the day before Trump’s\nInauguration, Kelly received a phone call from Rick Dearborn, a senior\nTrump aide, telling him that Metzler was unacceptable to the\nPresident-elect. “Dearborn told him, ‘Anyone associated with the Obama\nAdministration was no good. It didn’t matter what your credentials\nwere,’ ” someone with knowledge of the conversation told me. “Kelly was\nlivid.”", "At the start of the Presidential transition, Nielsen and Kelly didn’t\nknow each other personally, but they grew closer as the Inauguration\napproached. Nielsen, who was part of the transition team, was tasked\nwith preparing Kelly for his confirmation hearings. She was also angling\nfor an undersecretary job at a D.H.S. sub-agency called the National\nProtection and Programs Directorate, which specialized in cybersecurity.\n(According to the political news site ", ", Kelly planned to nominate her for that job.) The transition team had\ncreated a new position within D.H.S., known as the senior adviser to the\nWhite House, which was part of what the incoming Administration called\nits “beachhead team.” The ", " was  to staff government agencies with individuals who could serve as a\ncheck on career officials who might have reservations about Trump’s\nagenda. “It was basically the political commissar of the department,”\none official told me. When the person who filled the post, a former\nnaval intelligence officer and conservative-media personality named\nFrank Wuco, learned about Kelly’s pick for chief of staff, he blocked\nit. “They just didn’t want an Obama holdover,” the official told me. Although Kelly resented the interference, he acceded without a fight.\nMany senior officials at the department interpreted his acquiescence as\na sign of political naïveté. One of them told me, “His thinking was, ‘I\nhave my relationship with the President. The staff doesn’t matter so\nmuch.’ That was the military mind-set. And it was a mistake.” Nielsen\nemerged as the replacement.", "The early days of the Trump Administration were especially chaotic at\nD.H.S., beginning with the travel ban, which was instituted a week after\nTrump took office. Even though D.H.S. was in charge of implementing it\nat airports, Kelly was blindsided by the sudden announcement of the\nexecutive order initiating the ban, one former official told me. (Both\nthe White House and D.H.S. dispute this.) “He wasn’t really running the\ndepartment at the time,” the official said. ", ", a former Jeff Sessions staffer in his mid-thirties who served as a\nD.H.S. senior adviser, “was the only one who was really communicating\nwith the White House about the travel ban.” (A White House official told\nme, “Hamilton", " was a very valuable adviser to General Kelly, but to imply\nthat he played a more significant role than the Secretary is false.”) As\nthe initial chaos subsided, Kelly increasingly relied on Hamilton as he\nsettled into the job, particularly on technical issues related to\nimmigration policy. “Kelly looked to Hamilton as the expert,” the\nofficial said. “It was something like, ‘Gene, make sure I have this\nright.’ Whatever Hamilton said, Kelly ate it up.”", "Nielsen made the dynamic worse. Daily meetings among senior staff at\nD.H.S., which were routine in years past, were cancelled; in their\nplace, Nielsen started inviting Hamilton and other political appointees\nto meet directly with Kelly. Meanwhile, other senior officials,\nincluding the deputy secretary of D.H.S., struggled to get one-on-one\naccess to Kelly because Nielsen controlled his schedule and effectively\nshut them out. “She built a wall around him,” one former official told\nme. “She was with him constantly, even when he travelled. It was all\nabout her getting face time with Kelly and also making the political\nappointees happy.” (A D.H.S. spokesperson denied that Nielsen did\nanything out of the ordinary.)", "When Kelly was chosen as the White House chief of staff, in July,\nNielsen initially went with him to serve as his deputy and as a special\nassistant to the President. She appealed to people at the White House\nbecause she had Kelly’s support, and Trump loyalists considered her\nunthreatening. “Nielsen doesn’t want to piss off the President,” one of\nthe former officials told me. “She has zero independent political power\nbase in Washington. She’s a hundred per cent this White House and John\nKelly. They wanted someone who didn’t have a record speaking out against\nthe President and who wouldn’t go in that direction.”", "There was another advantage to having Nielsen as a nominee: she wouldn’t\ncause a protracted confirmation battle in the Senate. From 2002 to 2007,\nNielsen served in the Bush Administration, where she spent most of her\ntime overseeing domestic disaster-relief-and-prevention policy at the\nWhite House. She left for the private sector in the wake of controversy\nover how the Bush Administration had mishandled its response to\nHurricane Katrina. Though two congressional reports ", " Nielsen\nand her team for failing to inform the White House about\nbreaking developments on the ground in New Orleans, several\nAdministration officials ultimately came to her ", ".\nShe rebranded herself in the private sector. “Like many other people of\nthat era, she understood how big cybersecurity was going to be,” a\nformer colleague of hers from the Bush Administration told me. “She did\nher best to characterize herself as a cyber expert. But I’d put her on\nthe low end of that range of capacity and experience.” Still, it was\nenough to earn her notable cybersecurity-consulting jobs, an academic\nfellowship at George Washington University, and a prominent post at the\nWorld Economic Forum— irreproachably nonpartisan credentials.", "When Trump nominated her, in October, many officials at D.H.S. were\nstunned. “No one thinks she’s qualified,” one of them told me at the\ntime. “This is a big department, a young department. Leadership is\nespecially important, and she definitely doesn’t have the gravitas to be\nSecretary. It’s terrible for morale.” There were rumors of impending\nresignations. (The D.H.S. spokesperson denied this.) Nevertheless,\ndozens of former D.H.S. officials signed letters supporting Nielsen’s\nnomination in November, citing, among other things, that she was the\nfirst department head to have already served in the department. “This\nmeans that there will be no learning curve for Ms. Nielsen and she can\nhit the ground running at the DHS on Day One,” two former D.H.S.\nsecretaries, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, wrote in one of them. As\nexpected, Nielsen was swiftly confirmed.", "Homeland Security is unique among the Cabinet departments. When it was\ncreated, after 9/11, the disparate work of several different branches of\nthe federal government were merged into its portfolio. It has a massive\nbudget and a staff of some two hundred thousand employees, spanning the\nSecret Service, the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement. D.H.S.’s broad mission made it especially hard to manage;\neach sub-agency has a strong, independent culture of its own, and some\nareas, like immigration enforcement, are highly politicized. “We always\nhad to work extremely hard to make sure the department didn’t get turned\ninto a political tool,” one former D.H.S. official told me. “We tried to\nrun it like other departments that were above the fray, but it’ll always\nbe a challenge because of the immigration issue.”", "For the current Administration, D.H.S. enjoys a particular pride of\nplace. The President talks about immigration enforcement constantly,\nlauding ", " and Border Patrol officials and encouraging them to arrest\nmore people. The department has also driven domestic and ", " policy to an unusual degree under Trump. “All the decisions Nielsen is\ngoing to be making will be around immigration,” one former D.H.S.\nofficial told me. “She doesn’t know any of that stuff.” Her lack of\nexperience, the official added, means she’ll be especially dependent on\nideologues in the White House.", "“We are aware that there are fringe individuals and groups who do not\nsupport the President’s policies and the Department’s commitment to\nenforcing the existing rule of law,” Jonathan Hoffman, Homeland\nSecurity’s assistant secretary for public affairs, told me in an e-mail.\n“We are unsurprised they would", " resort to anonymous attacks on public\nservants in a misguided effort to obstruct the Administration’s efforts\nto better secure and protect our nation.”", "When, in January, Nielsen ended the temporary protected status of two\nhundred thousand Salvadoran immigrants, the former official told me, “that was\ndefinitely the hand of Stephen Miller and John Kelly.” Both were\nstrongly critical of the policy. The issue of T.P.S. for sixty thousand\nHondurans had come before Nielsen’s predecessor, Elaine Duke, last fall,\nduring her tenure as acting Secretary of D.H.S., but she resisted ", " to  cancel their status. The conflict led Duke to threaten her\nresignation, according to the Washington ", ". Though a D.H.S.\nspokesperson said, at the time, that the report had “zero factual\nbasis,” five Democratic senators ", " for\nadditional hearings on Nielsen’s nomination, in November, due to\nconcerns about the episode. “The nominee must now answer questions about\nher ability to maintain independence from her current immediate\nsuperior, the White House,” they wrote in a letter. (Additional hearings\nwere not held.)", "Late last Friday, Duke, who served as the Deputy Secretary under\nNielsen, announced her retirement. Department officials told the\nWashington ", " that Duke had been ", " since Nielsen took over. One current D.H.S. official told me that Nielsen “pushed her out.” (A D.H.S. spokesperson called the claim\n“ridiculous.”) Duke wasn’t the only senior department official to quit\nin February. James Nealon, an assistant secretary for international\nengagement and a former Ambassador to Honduras, also left. He, too, had\nreportedly clashed with the White House over immigration. One former\nD.H.S. official told me that it was unsurprising that senior members of\nthe department were leaving: its independence was being undermined.\n“Nielsen will say and do whatever the White House says,” the official\ntold me.", "Over the past month, as negotiations over immigration reform continued\nin Congress, D.H.S. joined the fray. On February 14th, during a week of\nintensive Senate talks on potential legislation, D.H.S. issued a\nstatement slamming the bipartisan bills opposed by the White House. One\nof the bills “Would Increase Illegal Immigration, Surge Chain Migration,\nContinue Catch and Release, and Give a Pathway to Citizenship to\nConvicted Alien Felons,” the release stated. Early the next morning, as\nthe White House lobbied against another bipartisan bill, D.H.S. released\na second statement attacking it, too. (A senior D.H.S. official told me\nthat the tone of the statement was necessary because there was little\ntime between the release of the bill and a floor vote.)", "Many, including Lindsey Graham, publicly speculated that Stephen Miller\nwas behind the statements. I messaged a source within the Department to\nask if there was any buzz about the statements among staffers. “The buck\nstops at the top,” the official responded. “Close coordination with the\nWhite House, clearly.”", "That day, I received an exasperated call from one of Nielsen’s former\ncolleagues at D.H.S. “This is highly abnormal,” the official said, of\nthe statements. “Rarely, if ever, do you put out a press release on a\nbill like this,” adding, “You can’t be seen as the lapdog of the White\nHouse. That makes the department into a political football.” I asked the former official if it really was so outrageous for a Presidential appointee to\nreiterate the White House line. It was, the official replied. “It\nhurts your ability to influence legislation when it really matters. If\nyou believe you represent the institution—D.H.S.—you care about the long\nterm. At the White House, and for Nielsen, it’s all about the short\nterm.”"]},

With no one to teach class, and no\nsubstitutes to call on, every school in the state closed. The lead-up to\nthe strike happened so quickly that, as it began, its aims were a little\nelusive. “I can’t tell you the number of people who have said, ‘I can’t\ntell you how we got here—I blinked, and here we are,’ ” Stephen Wotring,\nthe superintendent of schools in Preston County, said on Tuesday\nafternoon.", "The teachers spoke about two kinds of issues, overlapping but distinct.\nTheir primary grievance was that they made, by national standards, very\nlittle money, and that the governor had partly reneged on a promise to\nincrease their pay. The other issue was more complex. West Virginia has\nso many vacant teaching positions that, in many schools, grades had been\ncombined for efficiency, and teachers were teaching subjects for which\nthey were not certified or trained. A bill had been proposed in the\nstate legislature to lower teacher-certification standards in order to\nmore easily fill the vacant jobs, but, to the current teachers, this\nbill was evidence that politicians in the state were not genuinely\ninterested in improving the schools. On this matter, the rhetoric was\nespecially sharp. Hand in hand with the grievance over compensation was\na sense that the Appalachian middle class was in crisis.", "West Virginia has the most cinematic labor history of any state in the\ncountry, and, as this week began, the schools still closed, the teachers\nbegan to channel it explicitly. Teachers’-union officials made sure to\nemphasize that the movement to strike had begun among teachers in the\nsouthern part of the state, the coal regions, the old union strongholds\nfrom when West Virginia was known as a labor state, not a conservative\none. On Monday, the teachers staged a rally in Charleston, the state\ncapital, at which they wore red shirts (some also wore red bandannas) to\necho the chosen costume of the picketing mine workers of the Battle of\nBlair Mountain, in 1921, the largest strike in American history. West\nVirginia voted for President Trump by a huge margin in the 2016\nelection, but there had also been strong support for Bernie Sanders in\nthe Democratic primary. Among progressives, there has been hope that the\nstate might at some point revert from its more recent conservative\nidentity to its older pro-labor one. In the teachers’ strike, they saw a\nglimmer. Ken Fones-Wolf, a labor historian at West Virginia University,\ntold me that the strike was the most important in the state since at\nleast 1989. He said that he thought it might reflect a general turn in the\nstate’s politics. “Do I sound too rosy?” Fones-Wolf asked, and laughed.\n“I’ve been wrong before.”", "The most famous speaker at the Charleston rally was Cecil Roberts, the\nseventy-one-year-old president of the United Mine Workers of America,\nand a figure from a more combative era. (“He’s been jailed dozens of\ntimes!” a hype man cried out, by way of introduction.) Rough-voiced,\nshouty, and intent on raising the stakes, Roberts warned that the\nanti-union movement would try to sever the union from its leadership\n(“They attacked Jesus! They attacked Moses!”), and he compared the\nstrike to West Virginia’s labor actions past: the ten thousand coal\nminers who marched in Logan County, in the nineteen-twenties; the two\nthousand, himself among them, who walked out of mines in Appalachian\nVirginia, in 1989, when the Pittston Coal Company cut their benefits.\nBut there was a notable demographic difference between Roberts and his\nsupporters from the mine workers’ union—who came to the rally wearing\ncamo—and his schoolteacher audience, most of which was women, many of\nwhom had brought their children. Eventually, Roberts toned it down a\nlittle. “This is not really a strike,” he said. “This is when the good\npeople of West Virginia take back their state.”", "By midday Tuesday, with the schools still closed, Christine Campbell, the\nstate president of the American Federation of Teachers, was making the\nrounds at the capitol, trying to figure out what Jim Justice, the\nstate’s six-foot-seven-inch billionaire governor, would do. She seemed to view the\nstrike as somewhat less glorious than Roberts did, and the position of\nher members as precarious. West Virginia does not recognize the right of\npublic employees to bargain collectively. There are teachers in the\nstate, Campbell told me from the capitol, who “pick up fast-food shifts\non the weekends.” The state’s teachers make forty-four thousand dollars\na year on average, which ranks forty-eighth in the nation, and districts\nalong West Virginia’s borders have seen many instructors leave for\nhigher-paying jobs across state lines in Maryland, Virginia,\nPennsylvania, and Ohio. “We have students who have graduated from high\nschool without ever having had a certified math teacher,” Campbell said.\nShe kept switching between modes—between a narrow argument that the\nteachers deserved better compensation and a more general anxiety about\nthe strength of the state’s middle-class institutions. She said, “If we\ndon’t stand up for public education, we’re going to go the way the coal\nminers did.”", "In the past two and a half years—since the ", " announced itself as a crisis, and the 2016 Presidential campaign began\nin earnest—Appalachia has often been discussed in Campbell’s terms, as\nif the fate of the coal mines was becoming", " the fate of the region. The\ngeneral story of a cultural crisis matched the one presented in the\nwriter J. D. Vance’s memoir of Appalachian Ohio, “", ".”\nVance’s Appalachia was a clannish, abused place in which success was\nresented and family relations were chaotic. Once it became obvious that\nthe region was a center of the Trump phenomenon, arriving national\npolitical reporters saw things, at least partly, through Vance’s eyes. The\n", " columnist Roger Cohen ", ", “Trump’s perceived character . . . resonates in places like Appalachia where courage, country and\ncussedness are core values.” Liberal analysts have tended to consider\nthe region the scene of a moral comeuppance: the U.S. for decades\ntreated Appalachia like an internal colony, useful mostly for what could\nbe extracted from it, and its residents reacted by supporting an\nignorant racist for President.", "This tone has tended to annoy people who live in the region. Last month,\nthe Appalachian writer Elizabeth Catte published a spiky polemic with a\nhelpfully direct title, “", ".”\nCatte is a historian with a particular focus on photography, and part of\nher book is dedicated to mapping how precisely the contemporary images\nof the region mimic older ones. The great ", " magazine spread from\neastern Kentucky, in 1964, which was meant to illustrate a coming Great\nSociety initiative, consolidated the type: “children playing in bare\nshacks, restless with hunger.” In November, 2016, the Huffington Post\n", " a photographic examination of McDowell County, West Virginia, one of the\npoorest counties in the United States (headline: “This County Gives a\nGlimpse at the America That Voted Trump Into Office”), and it followed\nthe same aesthetic: frayed beards, ancient tractors, images exclusively\nin black-and-white. The effect, Catte believes, is that Appalachia is\nalways seen as stuck in some colorless and unchanging past, and\npopulated with—to take Catte’s phrase—“decent but damaged people looking\nfor a miracle.”", "The Appalachian left is a relatively small faction (when I called\nFones-Wolf, the labor historian at W.V.U., he mentioned that he was\nhaving dinner with Catte that very evening), and Catte, an officer of\nthe Charlottesville, Virginia, chapter of the Democratic Socialists of\nAmerica, captures its perspective. She points out that the diversity of\nthe region is badly underrecognized (“There are more people in\nAppalachia who identify as African-American than as Scots-Irish”) and\nemphasizes the region’s radical labor history: the mine-labor fights of\nHarlan County, Kentucky; the community health clinics; the training\nschool for civil-rights organizers. “If you saw through my eyes you’d\nsee hands in pockets and hands on guns and toes on picket lines,” she\nwrites of Appalachia.", "That doesn’t, however, fully describe the position of the West Virginia\nteachers, whose language is of access and opportunity, and whose efforts\nare to try to shrink the distance between West Virginia and the more\nprosperous parts of the country, rather than to provide a bristling\nresistance. In rural places, schools have a special function as the\ncenters of communities that sometimes have no other obvious focal point.\nTeachers in these schools are “stewards of the intellectual life,” as\none academic study of rural education put it. They also, sometimes,\ncarry the burden of aspiration. “The McDowell County School System\nunderstands that your child is so much more than a test score,” an\neducator named Nelson Spencer wrote to parents in the county, in a\n", " introducing himself as\ntheir new superintendent of schools, in 2012. He went on to promise not\njust free lunches and dental care but also Advanced Placement courses\nand college and career readiness. “This county is blessed with many fine\nschools, but our staff is . . . working tirelessly to make them even\nbetter.”", "Recently, the W.V.U. professor Erin McHenry-Sorber conducted a study of\nnew teachers in the state who had been assigned to rural schools. The\nteachers selected for the study had grown up in Appalachia, but, even\nso, what they emphasized about their postings was the poverty they found\nthere, the homeless children, the addicts among the parents. One new\nteacher in the study said, “We have a lot of parents that come to pick\ntheir kids up and are very—zombies I guess is the only way I can\ndescribe them. They look like zombies.” To these new teachers, who were\nnow educated, middle-class Appalachians, even their own home towns\nseemed to recede into black-and-white. A second new teacher told the\nresearchers, “Once I got to university town, maybe I went back, and I’m,\nlike, ‘Holy God, this place is dying.’ ”", "The strike was still in effect late Tuesday afternoon, and so\nWotring, the schools superintendent of Preston County, was at his desk\nwithout a whole lot to do. Wotring grew up in Preston County—an area,\njust east of Morgantown, where income levels are a bit below the state\naverage—and has worked in the school system there for thirty-six years,\nfirst as a high-school math and science teacher and then as a principal\nand, eventually, as a superintendent. He said the challenges that his\nschool faces because of its rural character were mundane (the tax base\nis thin; Preston County has more miles of road than all but one other\ncounty in the state, and so transportation is a headache) compared to\nanything as intangible as the culture. “It’s not like they’re backwoods\nkids who don’t know anything,” Wotring said. He mentioned a former\nscience student of his, Danny Moyer, who", " had gone to W.V.U., then to\ngraduate studies at U.C.L.A., and eventually to ", "’s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, where he had worked on the Mars rover. Talent tended to\nmigrate out of Preston County, but that was O.K. with Wotring. “My goal\nis not to educate the kids so they all stay here,” he said.", "Wotring’s sympathies were obviously with the teachers. His own district\nborders both Pennsylvania and Maryland, and keeping teachers in his\nschool, considering the higher salaries that they could earn just a few\nmiles away, required constant effort. He thought that what had really\nbothered the teachers, beyond the issues of pay and benefits, was the\nsuggestion, from the state legislature, that vacancies could be filled\nby people who were not certified to teach. “One of the things they are\nreally fighting for is to be recognized as professionals of value,” he\nsaid.", "There is a condescension in the general, black-and-white view of\nAppalachia—the kind that bothers Catte so much. But there is also an\nanxiety that the region might represent only an extreme version of the\nnational fear that the middle class might be squeezed out of existence.\nWotring believed that a certain political understanding had crystallized\nfor the teachers, a sense of where they stood. “If I really think this\nwas fuelled by anything this year, as opposed to any other year, it’s\nprobably been in the political culture that we find ourselves in—that\neverybody is willing, at this point, to stand up and state their opinion\nand stand for it,” he said. “People feel more entitled to do that than\never before.”", "Throughout the strike, it had been hard to pin down the position of\nGovernor Justice, a variable figure. One of the wealthiest men in the\nstate and a longtime Republican, Justice had switched parties to\nrun for governor in 2016 as a Democrat, before switching back last August, a\ndecision that he announced at a ", ", in Huntington.\nWhen I spoke with Campbell, the teachers’-union official, on\nTuesday, she told me she believed that the governor’s interest in\nimproving West Virginia’s schools was genuine. Still, she said, “I don’t\nfeel like he’s really connecting the dots about how you do that.” She\nsounded somewhat more optimistic about Justice than her membership did.\nOn Tuesday evening, the governor and the union leaders announced a deal\nto end the strike, in which the teachers would get the pay raise they\nwanted and the planned cuts to their benefits would be postponed by a\nyear.", "But the protests had evolved, and it wasn't so clear any longer that a\npay raise could resolve them. Quite quickly, it was apparent that the\nunion’s membership—a portion of which wanted a targeted tax on the\nextraction industries to fund education—would reject the deal. “I live\npaycheck to paycheck,” Katie Endicott, a thirty-one-year-old high-school\nteacher from Gilbert, ", " the ", ". Then she recounted the program,\nmandated by the state’s new health-insurance program, that required\nteachers to download an app that would check how many steps they took\neach day. “If I don’t earn enough points, and if I choose not to use the\napp, then I’m penalized $500 at the end of the year,” she said. “People\nfelt that was very invasive.” The union officials said that they had not\nexpected their membership to resist the deal. Governor Justice seemed\nexasperated. “I’m doing what all I possibly can,” he told reporters,\nthrough the window of his official S.U.V. “I’m not king.”", "The nature of Appalachia seems, at this moment, to matter very much to\nAmerican politics, and so each turn in the arguments about the region\nhas raised the stakes for the next. Vance’s description of a\npathological culture provoked Catte’s account of a diverse region\nmenaced by capital; the media’s certainty that West Virginia was Trump\ncountry deepened Roberts’s insistence that it belonged to its laborers.\n“Appalachia was not different from the rest of America,” the Appalachian\nhistorian Ronald Eller wrote ten years ago, in his history of the\nregion, “", ".” “It was in fact a mirror of what the nation was\nbecoming.” Maybe that is the real source of the suspense, in the\nconflict between educators wearing red and the Trump-supporting\ngovernor: it isn’t at all obvious whether these teachers are\nprofessionals in a middle-class place or workers whose footsteps get\ntracked by an app, because it isn’t at all obvious what the nation is\nbecoming."]},

The other charges—that Moser\ntook a D.C.-based mortgage exemption on her 2017 taxes and that her\ncampaign contracted her husband’s firm—also seem like pretexts: Moser\nhas since corrected her paperwork, and it’s surely pragmatic, not\ncorrupt, to enlist Revolution Messaging in the campaign. (The D.C.C.C.\nalso redirects plenty of candidates to their own consultants, ", ".)\nBut even after some Democrats expressed shock at the condemnation, the\nD.C.C.C. kept at it, telling the Texas Tribune that “Laura Moser’s\noutright disgust for life in Texas ", ", and would rob voters of their opportunity to flip Texas’ 7th in\nNovember.”", "What’s really happening is that the D.C.C.C. is using one strategic\nworry—that Texans won’t vote for a prodigal daughter—as a stand-in for\nthe real concern: that Moser is too far", " left. Mark Jones, a\npolitical-science professor at Rice University who’s been ", ",\ntold me, “Keep in mind, Clinton won the district by 1.4 per cent, but\ngeneric Republican judicial candidates won by twelve and sixteen per\ncent. This Democratic candidate is going to need to convince a large\nnumber of people who generally vote Republican, a large number of Greg\nAbbott voters.” Abbott, the state’s governor, won sixty per cent\nof the vote in 2014. “What the D.C.C.C. is saying is that there’s no way\nthese people are going to vote for Laura Moser, who’s been calling for\nTrump’s impeachment.” You couldn’t fault the D.C.C.C. for that\nstatement, Jones said. “They’re right on the money that Laura Moser is\nthe most far left of all the candidates, and that she would be a real\nliability in C.D. 7.”", "Others, of course, disagree. John Floyd, a Houston criminal-defense\nlawyer and Democratic precinct chair who endorsed Moser, told me,\n“Laura’s issues are bread-and-butter American issues—that we believe in\nthe value of equality, that we need to keep our children safe.” Floyd\nsaid that the D.C.C.C.’s opposition to Moser has actually increased\nsupport for her among some Houston Democrats who had voted for other\ncandidates: he’d met some of them at a Moser rally last Saturday, he\nsaid. “A lot of more progressive-minded voters here believe that the\nD-Trip should not be getting involved here—that the good-old-boy\nestablishment that’s been running the show has led to where we are, with\nthe President we’ve got,” he added. The Democratic establishment that\nexists in Houston has always tended toward pro-business centrism: their\napproach is distinct from that of new, proudly progressive groups like\nOur Revolution, the organization that was spun out of Bernie Sanders’s\nPresidential campaign and that recently endorsed Moser. (Floyd is a\nchair of the local Our Revolution committee.)", "One side of this debate is being naïve, but it’s not immediately evident\nwhich side that is: maybe Houston has more progressive potential than it\ngets credit for, or maybe reaching moderate Republicans is truly the\nonly way to win. (That was arguably ", " in\nGeorgia—though his opponent, Karen Handel, was probably stronger than\nCulberson is now.) It also remains to be seen whether the D.C.C.C.’s\nintervention will have its intended effect. Moser, who has recently been\naccompanied on the campaign trail by ", " (a\nhigh-profile presence during Ossoff’s race as well), said that her\ncampaign had ", " in\nthe three days following the D.C.C.C. statement. She told the Tribune that this reflected local aversion to “politics as usual,” and to the\nidea that national Democrats know what’s best for Houston.", "Texas is changing—it’s been changing for decades, though that change has\nbeen masked by the stagnant predictability of politicians like\nCulberson. “When I first started practicing law in Harris County, in\n1994, there was not a single Democrat elected on any of the benches,”\nFloyd told me. Then, in the last election, a blue sweep in Harris County\nhit every countywide office. Floyd mentioned that his son had run for a\nschool-board seat in the conservative suburb Pearland on a platform that\ncalled for transgender bathroom equality—and won. There are many shades\nof Texan identity. Would the well-heeled voters in this district recoil\nat Moser’s distaste for small-town living, or would some of them\nsecretly agree?", "Early voting began on February 20th, and Democrats have been voting in\nrecord numbers. By Thursday, Democratic turnout in the fifteen largest\ncounties in Texas was higher than Republican turnout; it was double the\nDemocratic turnout from the midterm primaries in 2014. The Republican\nprimary vote may also be telling, Jones told me. Culberson is running\nagainst a blip of an opponent, Edward Ziegler—a vote for him would most\nlikely be a protest vote against Culberson, signifying a person who’s\nmore likely to defect in November. In Houston, the permafrost of\nBush-era orthodoxy is melting. “I’ve felt like a little blue dot in a\nsea of red,” a Houston resident named Ruthie Miller, who went to high\nschool with both Moser and Fletcher, wrote to me over e-mail. “Since the\n2016 election I’ve realized I’m not alone.”"]},

Bannister was the most ordinary of athletes. He was\na medical student at the time of his record run, in 1954. He trained\nduring his lunch hour. A few weeks before, when things weren’t going\nwell, he took off with his friend for some hiking in Scotland.", "Running was his hobby: he barely pursued it past his graduation because,\npresumably, he had better things to do with his time.

(The latter is roughly how fast\nOlympic medallists in that distance run.) Almost instantly, others\npointed out the foolishness of the question.

On what he recalled as a “windy and rain-sodden\nday” in 1954, he was not only racing the clock at the track but, in a\nway, the shadows of the other two men, training for the same goal\nthousands of miles away.

And so, too, on that day at\nOxford, he covered the last turns on the track by himself. With three\nhundred metres to go, he left his friend Chataway behind and set off on\na lonely, unprecedented journey, his long arms and legs churning, his\nbody tilted slightly back, lost in his own private, effortful reverie.\nAnd then, upon crossing the tape, the thing done, he went limp, and\ncollapsed into the arms of the waiting crowd."]},

So minimal is the ceremoniousness\nthat, whenever it exists, it tends to take on outsized meaning.", "One such ceremony took place on Monday, when Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu met with President Trump in the Oval Office. Netanyahu tried\nto project an air of business as usual—the relationship between the\nUnited States and Israel “has never been better,” he gushed—even as\nTrump may have quickened the Israeli leader’s pulse by saying,\nnonchalantly, that “we have a shot” at “doing” peace with the\nPalestinians. But only one thing was on the mind of the travelling\nIsraeli press corps. A reporter asked, “Prime Minister Netanyahu, would\nyou like to comment about the latest news coming from Israel?”", "“I will later,” Netanyahu replied quietly, maintaining a glued-on smile.\nIt was a momentary exchange, imperceptible, perhaps, to American\naudiences, but not to Israelis who lately mine the Prime Minister’s\nevery move for clues of what’s to come.", "On February 13th, Netanyahu, citing poor weather conditions for the\nflying of his government-issued helicopter, abruptly scrapped plans to\nattend the opening of a rehabilitation facility in the northern city of\nTiberias. Reports in the Israeli press later confirmed why. Netanyahu\nhad learned that at 8:45 that evening, the police were set to issue\ntheir findings in two corruption investigations against him: one, called\nCase 1000, alleging that he had accepted bribes from two tycoons in the\nform of cigars, champagne, and jewelry for his wife, Sara; the\nother—Case 2000—an investigation into whether he had colluded with the\npublisher of a major newspaper to receive favorable coverage, all of\nwhich he has vehemently denied. In a third corruption case, a former\nNetanyahu spokesman is alleged to have approached a judge in 2015 with a\nproposed deal: the judge would be named attorney general if she dropped\na case against Netanyahu’s wife for misusing a hundred thousand dollars\nin public funds. (The Netanyahus have dismissed the charges as “absurd\nand unfounded,” and referred to the alleged offer to the judge as\n“hallucinatory.”)", "The “news from Israel” that the reporter asked Netanyahu about as he met\nwith the Trump were reports that the Prime Minister’s former spokesman,\nNir Hefetz, had agreed to become the third former aide to coöperate with\ninvestigators and turn over recordings of Netanyahu and his wife in\nexchange for not standing trial. Hefetz’s coöperation could be the most\nsignificant development yet in the corruption cases surrounding\nNetanyahu.", "After Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, his office issued a statement\nsaying that the latest allegations were “nonsense.” For months,\nNetanyahu and his shrinking inner circle of advisers have tried to\nprepare his base for the worst by publicly stating that the police were\ngoing to implicate him in corruption cases. “So what?” Netanyahu told a\ngathering of supporters last December. “Over sixty per cent of police\nrecommendations end up in the trash.”", "Yet the decision by the head of the Israeli police on February 13th to recommend\nthat Netanyahu be prosecuted on two counts of bribery,\nfraud, and breach of trust undermined his denials. Most damaging,\nperhaps, was the disclosure of an alleged quid pro quo with one of the\ntycoons, the Israeli Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, which Netanyahu\nhad until then tried to portray as a gift of mere trifles by a friend\nwith nothing promised in return. But the sum of money the police\noutlined—nearly three hundred thousand dollars—could no longer be\nbrushed off as merely “a cigar,” as Netanyahu had described it. One by\none, the police listed assurances from Netanyahu to Milchan, including\nthe promise of a ten-year extension of a tax-exemption law for\nrepatriated Israelis, from which Milchan would have directly benefited. Milchan denies wrongdoing and maintains that the gifts were not bribes.", "Moments before the police released their recommendation that he be\nprosecuted, a beleaguered Netanyahu, flanked by two Israeli flags, gave\na fiery speech from his residence. “You know I do everything with only\none thing in mind—the good of the country,” he said. “Not for cigars\nfrom a friend, not for media coverage, not for anything. Only for the\ngood of the state.” In a sign of desperation, he then opted for the\nIsraeli equivalent of two Hail Marys: he recounted his long and storied\nservice in the military and name-dropped the late Shimon Peres as\nsomeone who, like him, had worked to advance the interests of Milchan.\n(There is no Israeli politician, it would seem, that the film mogul\ndidn’t try to cozy up to.) The police findings, Netanyahu concluded,\nwere “biased and extreme, and full of holes like a Swiss cheese.”", "Both cases are now with Israel’s attorney general, a Netanyahu\nappointee, who will decide whether to indict the Prime Minister. Another\ninvestigation, which has ensnared some of the people closest to\nNetanyahu but in which he hasn’t officially been named as a target,\ninvolves suspected conflicts of interest surrounding Israel’s purchase\nof German-made submarines and missile ships. The breadth of the\ninquiries attests", " to three hallmarks that have come to define\nNetanyahu’s rule: hobnobbing with moneyed interests, an obsession with\nthe media, and a sense that he alone can promote Israel’s security\ninterests.", "Israeli law prohibits a cabinet minister from serving under indictment\nbut says nothing about an indicted Prime Minister. This means that\nNetanyahu could, in theory, govern through the end of his term, in\nNovember, 2019, even if charges were brought against him. Many analysts\nwouldn’t put this past him. “It’s the Louis XIV syndrome,” Nahum Barnea,\nIsrael’s preëminent columnist, for ", " told me. “More than\njust saying that the state is him, his feeling and the feeling of those\naround him, is that the damage to the party and the country by him\nresigning would be so great that it’s worth doing things that would have\nbeen unthinkable were it anyone else.”", "Still, there are indications that Netanyahu’s coalition of\nultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties—fragile to begin with—might\nnot survive an indictment. Netanyahu can afford to lose only six seats\nout of parliament’s hundred and twenty seats for his government to\ncollapse. While Likud still comes in ahead of all other parties in\nrecent polls, its coalition partners “might not stand the heat in the\nkitchen of public opinion,” Amit Segal, a political correspondent for\nIsrael’s Channel 2, told me.", "Other Israeli leaders had been stained by corruption before. Ehud Olmert\nserved sixteen months in prison for bribery and fraud; before him, Ariel\nSharon was alleged to have accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in\nwhat became known as the “Greek Island Affair,” though no charges were\never brought against him. The difference, according to Doron Navot, a\nscholar of Israeli corruption who has written extensively on the\nsubject, is that Netanyahu’s misconduct is part of a far-reaching\npolitical agenda. Netanyahu has served longer than any other Israeli\nPrime Minister apart from David Ben-Gurion, yet Netanyahu still operates\nas an underdog, fuelled by divisiveness and resentment against the\ncountry’s “élites”: the courts, media, academia, and now even the\npolice. “Sharon and Olmert didn’t go against democratic institutions;\nthey were part of them,” Navot told me. “Netanyahu doesn’t simply go\nagainst these institutions and tries to annihilate them, he is motivated\nby a belief in his singular role in Jewish history. That in itself\nbreeds corruption, because it can be used to justify almost anything.”", "A week after the police released findings in Cases 1000 and 2000, a\nNetanyahu confidant who once ran the communications ministry under him\nagreed to provide evidence in a vast and separate graft inquiry, known\nas Case 4000, involving Israel’s telecommunications giant, Bezeq. “I\ncarried out clear instructions from Netanyahu,” Shlomo Filber told\npolice investigators, according to Israel’s Channel 2. “He clarified to\nme who should be looked out for, and how.” (“This never happened,”\nNetanyahu said in response.)", "Of the various investigations, the allegation that Netanyahu’s wife\nmishandled public funds by ordering catering services when the\nNetanyahus already employed a full-time chef may seem of secondary\nimportance—a mere distraction. But the alleged efforts to clear her name\nby bribing a judge appear to bolster what insiders have long argued:\nthat Sara’s hold on her husband is such that her personal grudges often\ndictate his policy. It is in large part because of Sara, those who know\nthem say, that Netanyahu now finds himself with no heir apparent. As Uzi\nArad, Netanyahu’s former national-security adviser, told me, “She\ndirects him, and points at real or imagined enemies, and by doing that\nshe has exacerbated his already existing paranoias.” Arad added, “There\nare people she doesn’t allow to come to the residence. Anyone who\ncriticizes them is seen as a leftist, even if their credentials are to\nthe right of Netanyahu.”", "Another figure who has grown in importance as Netanyahu’s inner circle\nhas narrowed is the Prime Minister’s eldest son, Yair. At twenty-six,\nYair still lives with his parents at taxpayers’ expense. He doesn’t have\na job and is known primarily for directing much of his father’s\nsocial-media presence and for tarnishing Israeli human-rights groups\nonline. In January, an illicit audio recording was released of Yair,\nduring a night out with friends, talking about paying prostitutes and\nstrippers and offering to set up his ex-girlfriend with an acquaintance\nin order to settle a financial debt. The combination of his denigration\nof women (“Let’s ‘load’ the waitress,” Yair told his friends at one\npoint), the amounts of money being tossed around casually, as well as\nthe fact that a state-funded driver chauffeured the drunken group from\none strip club to another, made for explosive material in Israel. Yair\nhas since issued a tepid apology. But his dubious reputation was nothing\nnew.", "Last summer, after the deadly neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville,\nVirginia, Yair weighed in from across the ocean, drawing an equivalence\nbetween neo-Nazis and leftist demonstrators. “To put things in\nperspective. I’m a Jew, I’m an Israeli, the neo nazis scums in Virginia\nhate me and my country. But they belong to the past,” he wrote on his\nprivate Facebook page. “However, the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my\ncountry (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger\nand stronger.” The post was taken down two days", " after it was published,\nand it’s unclear whether the Prime Minister knew about it. But the\nmessage resonated: Netanyahu had thrown in his lot with Trump and with\nrising anti-liberal forces.", "Israelis have generally drifted rightward after the failure of two\nrounds of peace talks, in 2000 and 2008, and Netanyahu has become\nincreasingly reliant on a far-right coalition of parties. Yet polls show\nthat the dominance of his right-wing bloc may now be imperilled. Its\nmain threat comes from a four-year-old centrist party called Yesh Atid\n(“There Is a Future”), headed by Yair Lapid, a telegenic former\njournalist and television host who has taken on the anti-corruption\nmantle. In a surprising recent revelation, Lapid was named a key state\nwitness in Case 1000. Lapid served as the finance minister from 2013 to\n2015; he is said to have testified that, during that period, Netanyahu\npersonally asked him to extend the tax-exemption law that would have\nbenefitted Milchan, a request that Lapid turned down but never reported\nat the time.", "Netanyahu’s visit to Washington is certain to endow him with the stature\nhe desperately needs. His speech on Tuesday to the pro-Israel group\n", " will provide him with the ultimate platform to hold forth on the\none issue that may stand between him and political ouster: Iran.", "Last month, an Iranian drone entered Israeli airspace, from the north,\nand was felled by Israeli missiles. The drone was fashioned after an\nAmerican aircraft that Iran intercepted in 2011, suggesting that Iranian\nmilitary capabilities have grown far more sophisticated than analysts\nhad previously thought. In retaliation, the Israeli Air Force, which has\nbeen operating covertly in Syria since 2012, sent F-16 fighter jets to\nattack an Iranian command center in central Syria. On the flight back to\nIsrael, Syrian anti-aircraft missiles struck one of the F-16s. It was\nthe first time an Israeli plane had been downed since 1982, an\nindication that the regional map has changed dramatically: Iran has\ntaken advantage of the chaos in Syria to entrench its Revolutionary\nGuard forces less than five miles from the Israeli border.", "Sixty-nine per cent of Israelis believe that, despite the international\nagreement reached in 2015, Tehran is on the verge of achieving nuclear\ncapabilities that would be existentially threatening to the state of\nIsrael, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. And with Iran now\nwidening its influence in Syria and in Lebanon, by way of Hezbollah,\nIsraelis may be too wary to replace Netanyahu, their self-styled Mr.\nSecurity.", "Despite the cheerful air that Netanyahu tried to project during his\nmeeting with Trump, those who know him say that he is increasingly\nrattled, on edge, and isolated. His entourage of close advisers is\ngone—all embroiled in scandals and forced to resign or, worse, testify\nagainst him. But Netanyahu has been prematurely written off before. In\nthe days leading up to the last elections, in 2015, polls showed Likud\nlosing by four seats to the Zionist Union (a center-left coalition of\nthe historic Labor Party and a smaller party called Hatnuah). But then\ncame Netanyahu’s famous dog whistle—Arab voters were “coming out in\ndroves to the ballot boxes,” he warned—and Likud won handily. He was\ndeemed “the magician,” back from the dead.", "This time, however, his air of invincibility is punctured. Many in\nIsrael believe that he may call for early elections, if only to preëmpt\nhaving to run with an indictment hanging over his head. “There’s an\nuneasy feeling in Likud that the slogan that brought down the Party in\nthe nineteen-nineties—‘Corrupt people, we’re sick of you’—is back, and\nthe fear is that Likud will fall because of this,” Yoaz Hendel, a former\ncommunications adviser for Netanyahu, told me. All this has led\nNetanyahu’s admirers and detractors alike to imagine a scenario that was\nonce unimaginable: a political landscape without him.", "If there is a signature achievement to Benjamin Netanyahu’s decade in\npower, it may be the hollowing out of political debate in Israel. For\nmuch of the country’s history, the public has been split into two\nprevailing world views: those who stress historic rights—who see the\nBiblical Land of Israel as covering the entire area between the\nMediterranean Sea and the Jordan River—and those who believe in civil\nrights, arguing that the occupation of another people is not only\nunsustainable but unconscionable. The left reigned exclusively from 1948\nuntil 1977; the right has ruled for most of the past four decades. But\nboth camps used to have more or less equal numbers. Not anymore. Only\neight per cent of Israeli Jews now define themselves as left wing;\nthirty-seven per cent identify with the right, and fifty-five per cent\nwith the center. And just what “the center” means has changed, too: it\nis now considered a legitimate position to support the expulsion or\ntransfer of Arabs from Israel. In fact, forty-eight per cent of Jewish\nIsraelis support the idea, compared with forty-six per cent who don’t,\naccording to a Pew Research poll from 2016.", "But these statistics bely an even greater transformation that Israeli\nsociety has undergone during the Netanyahu years: a turning inward,\nagainst so-called “enemies from within.” The sense of solidarity that\nhas characterized Israeli society since the founding of the state is\nfraying, while sectarianism, orchestrated by Netanyahu, is on the rise.\nThe Palestinian question rarely features in the public discourse\nanymore. There is no talk of a", " two-state solution, because the consensus\nis that the status quo is going to reign. When Netanyahu began his first\nterm in office, in 1996, there were a hundred and thirty-four thousand\nJewish settlers living in the West Bank and Gaza; now, in the West Bank,\nthere are about half a million. This mushrooming of the settlement\nproject has made the drawing of a future Palestinian state with any\ncohesive borders a monumental challenge.", "Netanyahu has remade Likud in his image—so much so that it is now\nunclear whether the Party can survive without him. “The day after Bibi,\nin Likud, an all-out war will break out,” Tal Shalev, a political\nreporter for the online news site Walla, told me. While no government\nminister has come out against Netanyahu, so far, many are said to be\ngrowing restless. Yet not a single Likud leader today is seen as Prime\nMinister material.", "The only two figures who consistently score high in national opinion\npolls have both left Likud in recent years, reportedly feeling waylaid\nby Netanyahu. The first is Moshe Kahlon, a popular former communications\nminister who is single-handedly credited with breaking up Israel’s\nmobile-phone monopoly. Kahlon is now the head of a centrist party,\nKulanu (“All of Us”), whose platform focusses primarily on\nbread-and-butter issues. Kulanu garnered ten seats in the last election,\na moderate achievement, and Kahlon was appointed the finance minister.\nHe is seen to be in no rush to topple the government. In many ways, he\nmay be the last peg holding together Netanyahu’s Jenga tower of a\ncoalition.", "Gideon Sa’ar is the other well-regarded ex-Likudnik. Sa’ar finished\nfirst in the Likud primaries in both 2008 and 2012, but, when Netanyahu\npassed on giving him a serious ministerial portfolio after the 2015\nelection, he announced a “time out” from politics: “There is crazy\nhatred” between him and Netanyahu, Shalev told me. Sa’ar has been\nunequivocal about his intentions since. “My goal is to lead the country\nin the future,” he said last summer.", "What would a government under these possible contenders look like? The\ndifference, analysts say, would be one of shading, not of substance. If\nNetanyahu’s rule is characterized by a seizing of the base and then an\nappeal to the center, almost as an afterthought, some of his potential\nreplacements—such as Kahlon—may attempt to rule from the center first\nand only then cater to the right. Still, with a majority of Knesset\nseats firmly in control of a right-wing bloc, the diplomatic stasis and\nthe attempt to weaken Israel’s democratic institutions will likely\ncontinue apace. So will the process of ", " or “religionization,”\nin schools, universities, and the military.", "“The question is how much the behavior of the past year or two is\nsetting up new norms, and that’s what I fear most,” Zeev Sternhell, a\nleading Israeli intellectual and scholar of fascism, told me. He pointed\nto two areas of particular concern: the attempt by the government to\ndelegitimize the Supreme Court and a narrowing of the definition of\ndemocracy to include only the process of election and a protection of\nthe rights of the majority. “Those two things have so embedded\nthemselves into our society that they may be rooted as the new normal\nafter Bibi.”", "Israel’s Labor Party has seen better days. Its primaries tend to draw\nout the diminishing old guard of the Zionist left: weathered\nkibbutzniks, veteran union members, silver-haired academics. Last July,\nhowever, one candidate was in every way atypical. Avi Gabbay, the\nseventh child of immigrants from Morocco, is fifty-one, grew up in\nIsrael’s impoverished transit camps and rose to become the C.E.O. of the\ntelecommunications company Bezeq before joining Kahlon’s Kulanu Party,\nin 2014. Gabbay later stunned the political establishment—perhaps none\nmore so than his mentor, Kahlon—by announcing his intention to switch\nparties and seek the Labor chairmanship. Kahlon has reportedly not\nspoken to him since.", "In the Labor primary last year, Gabbay vanquished his opponents and\nturned his sights on Netanyahu in his acceptance speech. “If we stick to\nthe old system of saying ‘Netanyahu isn’t good,’ and this, and that, and\nchampagne bottles, we won’t beat him,’” Gabbay said.", "After Gabbay’s surprise victory, he accepted an offer from Ayman Odeh,\nthe leader an alliance of predominantly Arab parties known as the Joint\nList, to broker a phone call between Gabbay and Mahmoud Abbas, the head\nof the Palestinian Authority. “It was a good phone call,” Odeh told me.\nBut then, about a month later, Gabbay’s public statements were much less\nconciliatory. “We won’t sit with the Joint List in the same government,\nperiod. We have nothing in common with them,” Gabbay told voters in\nsouthern Israel. A few days later, he told an interviewer that peace\nwouldn’t necessarily require uprooting any Jewish settlement. His\nstatements hit dovish Israelis like a dagger. “A Labor Party leader who\nsays it would be possible to have peace with the Palestinians without\ndismantling any settlements is either mocking himself and others, or is\nwillfully lying,” Sternhell told me. “A serious man he is not.”", "Such is the predicament of the left in Israel: Stick to your ideology\nand you wind up alienating most of the public; abandon it, and you risk\nlosing your base. Immediately after Gabbay’s primary win, polls showed a\nsmall bump for Labor—narrowing the gap with Likud from six seats to four\nor five—but, by February,", " any advantage had disappeared. Labor is\nprojected to secure fewer than fifteen seats in the next election, a\nthorough humiliation.", "Yair Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, targets Israel’s swelling middle\nclass—the same young urbanites who were part of the social-justice\nmovement that took to the streets of Israel in 2011. Lapid’s base is\naggrieved by what’s referred to in Israel as “the inequality of the\nburden.” They serve in the military and pay high taxes, while other\nsectors of society, especially ultra-Orthodox communities, are exempt\nfrom military service and are seen as living off the state.", "Because of his good looks and charisma, the fifty-four-year-old Lapid\nhas been dubbed by some the “Israeli Macron.” Like the French President,\nhe has enjoyed an outsider status despite having served as finance\nminister. In 2013, Yesh Atid upended the political map by winning\nnineteen seats and becoming Israel’s second largest party. In 2015, it\nslipped down to eleven seats. Now, however, there is talk of the Party\ngoing all the way. Polls in January showed that, by uniting with\nKahlon’s party and poaching a former I.D.F. chief of staff to run as a\nfuture defense minister, Lapid could beat Netanyahu. Without those\npartners, though, Netanyahu would prevail in a head-to-head contest.", "As the head of a new party, Lapid is ideologically unburdened. He is a\npragmatist, an adapter—or as some say, an opportunist. “Lapid has a\npolitical program that is very organized and its name is Yair Lapid,”\nOdeh told me.", "I spoke to Lapid, by phone, in January. He had recently returned from a\nmeeting of centrist politicians in the Netherlands and he clearly wished\nto position himself in line with moderation. “The real political fight\nis between populists and responsible leaders,” he told me. “After the\ntones in the American election, and after Brexit, the world wants\nresponsible leadership.” The implication was that Netanyahu represented\nthe other side—that of the irresponsible populists.", "Yet Lapid is also aware that, in order to mount a real challenge against\nNetanyahu, he cannot afford to alienate the Prime Minister’s base. When\nI told him that there seemed to be a contradiction between his own\ngrowing popularity and Israelis’ professed drift rightward, he\ndisagreed. “The terms ‘right’ and ‘left’ are becoming irrelevant,” he\ntold me. “When people ask about my party, I say that we’re a\nnational-liberal party. That defines us much more than left, right, or\ncenter,” he added.", "Press him for specifics on the Palestinian issue, however, and he grows\nvague. “Things need to be done,” he says, but “cautiously.” He also\nargued that regarding Syria and Iran there was no space between the\ncountry’s political parties. “On that issue, there is no internal debate\nin Israel,” he said. “So then the voters are divided not over what’s\nbeing stated but whether or not they believe the person making the\nstatements.”", "And that, in the end, may be as accurate a summary as any for where\nIsrael is at as it enters its seventieth year. Israeli politics\nincreasingly take place in the yawning gap between nice-sounding\nrhetoric and what is perceived to be a chaotic and volatile regional\nreality—always too chaotic and too volatile for meaningful negotiations\nto take place. Absent any diplomatic progress, the debate turns to\ndomestic issues, and elections hinge on perceptions of the political\nsystem itself and the legitimacy of its democratic institutions. These\nare crucial issues, to be sure, but they are ones that shouldn’t be\ncalled into question in the first place in a liberal democracy.", "It is an irony of no small proportions that Netanyahu may, in time, be\nviewed as the instigator of his own undoing: by neutering political\ndebate in Israel, he has made the focus personal, drawing attention to\nthe murky underside of his governing. Assuming that he will still be at\nthe top of his party’s ticket, the next Israeli election will be less an\nopen race than a referendum on his rule. There is a common saying in\nIsrael: elections are not won; they are lost. With no term limits for\nPrime Ministers, power is seen as the incumbent’s to lose. This is all\nthe more true these days, with a Prime Minister who has at least four\nopen investigations aimed at him. Does it feel like the end of an era, I\nasked Lapid, toward the end of our conversation. “It does,” he said,\nthen corrected himself. “It feels like the ", " of the end.”"]},

In the days before Tuesday’s primary elections\nin Texas, the race for the Republican nomination for judge (in effect,\nthe chief executive) of Bastrop County—the far suburbs of Austin,\nusually reliably Republican territory—became especially heated. The\nincumbent was a relatively mild-mannered man named Paul Pape (pronounced “poppy,” like the bagel topping). His challenger was a\nretired Air Force officer and Ron Paul enthusiast named Don Loucks, who\nfor years had been writing a Thursday column—titled “Don’s Thoughts”—in\nthe local paper, the Bastrop ", ".", "Loucks’s thoughts, at least the ones he curated for publication, had a\ncareful, readerly tone, but also echoed the preoccupations and extremity\nof conservative talk radio. In one column, Loucks insisted that, under\napartheid, South Africa had been a “powerful nation with a thriving,\ndiverse economy” but that after the white government lost power,\n“societal descent set in.” This summer, after a neo-Nazi ", " in\nCharlottesville, Virginia, was interrupted by a counter-rally, Loucks\nwondered, “Why were the Unite the Right described as fascists and\nneo-Nazis when Antifa was following the Brown Shirt script from 1930s\nGermany?” He once argued that Christian immigrants assimilated more\nnaturally into American society than Muslim immigrants, because America\nwas “founded as a Christian nation. It’s who we are. It’s that simple.”", "After Loucks declared his candidacy for judge, his column became a\nfixation for a Bastrop resident and retired firefighter named Vic\nVreeland, who had started subscribing to the ", " after ", ", the MSNBC host, had implored her viewers to support their local\npapers. It seemed to Vreeland that Loucks had been, in his weekly\ncolumn, obliterating the line between what was part of normal politics\nin Bastrop County and what was fringe. Vreeland decided to start a Web\nsite, which he called Know Loucks, to alert the rest of Bastrop County\nto this issue. Vreeland was not shy. On the Web site, he said that\nLoucks shared the views of “white supremacist organizations like the\nalt-right movement, skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan.” Loucks, Vreeland\nwrote, “adheres to the tenets of fascism.” Vreeland compared Loucks to\nDonald Trump, and Trump to Hitler. He bought Facebook ads to make the same\npoints to people who lived in Bastrop County. “I’m like the Russia\nbots,” Vreeland told me on Tuesday.", "Political language has loosened over the past three years, and it’s no longer\nuncommon to hear officeholders and office-seekers denounced as white\nsupremacists, as racists, as misogynists. (In January the New Jersey\nDemocrat Bob Menendez, no one’s idea of a radical, denounced an\nanti-immigration Trump ad as “more racism, more xenophobia, more white\nnationalism.”) One way to view Vreeland’s Web site was as a form of\nindustrious flailing, to find a label that would still disqualify\nLoucks—that would stick. Vreeland had done some volunteer work for Pape,\nthe incumbent, but he thought Pape was too soft on Loucks. Loucks had\nbeen going after Pape, calling him a “tin-pot dictator,” and, at a\ncandidate forum last week, the judge’s calculations appeared to change.\nPape denounced Loucks as a “far-right radical” and a “right-wing\nextremist.” The ", " registered the disjunction in its headline\n“Claims of Radical Politics, Dictatorship Surface in Bastrop Judge\nRace,” over twinned photos of the candidates—two serious, balding white\nmen.

He told the paper, “I suppose I should consider\nthat a badge of honor.”", "The 2018 election season has now begun.

O’Rourke has\nattracted national attention, but Cruz looks to have a formidable hold\non his seat. Democratic turnout in Tuesday’s primary was strong, though\nperhaps not as strong as the Party would have liked. And beneath the\npartisan rebalancing is the matter of whether the extremism of the early\nTrump era is an aberration or a permanent feature—whether Democrats will\nhave the leverage, or Republicans the inclination, to reënforce a taboo.", "In Bastrop County, Loucks was not a figure from the social fringe.\nHe had been active in local politics for a decade—he had once been a\ncounty commissioner, and his wife holds an elected office, too—and in\nhis campaign he liked to criticize Pape for being too cautious about\ndevelopment in the county and to talk about improving Bastrop’s\nemergency response. “I’m a conservative, but not a nut conservative,”\nLoucks told me when I reached him by phone, just before the election.\nBut then there was the evidence of those columns.", "In a small county, it’s a little easier to do: an established politician\ncan wield significant influence, and an outraged blogger can help to\nshape a race.

Minisee helped assemble a\nteam—several of whom had personally been victims of gun violence,\nincluding a teacher from Sandy Hook—and they distributed tool kits and\npaired students with local activists.", "DeSouza and others at Packer heard of the movement and began organizing\na two-hour rally in downtown Brooklyn.

An adolescent\nrepeated “We are the ninety-nine per cent” several times before turning\nto his friend and whispering, “Wait, what does this one mean again?”", "The mood before the ceremony was light, and the protesters, being\nteen-agers, too, took endless selfies.

DeSouza was understandably\nworried about the prospect of getting a thousand teen-agers to shut up—a\ntask any teacher would deem impossible—but when the moment came the\nsilence was real. “I think that set the tone for the rest of the day,”\nshe said.", "Afterward, DeSouza ran around carrying a clipboard and muttering\nrapid-fire orders into a walkie-talkie. She was organizing the lineup of\nspeeches, and she had the slightly harried look of a stage manager.\n“It’s been really overwhelming to coördinate all of this,” she said.\n“But this is the most incredible feeling.” Several grownups spoke,\nincluding the Brooklyn Borough President, a member of City Council, and\nthe New York City Comptroller, who shouted, “The adults have failed you”\nto raucous applause. But the stars of the rally were the dozen or so\nstudent speakers, who were precocious, well informed, and moving. A few\nhigh schoolers approached from the audience and asked to give impromptu\nspeeches. One performed a spoken-word poem. “Some of the best teaching\nis when students take control of the learning,” De Jésus, the Packer\nprincipal, told me. “It was pretty amazing to see.”", "Khaja Daniel, a ninth grader at Packer, gave one of the final speeches\nof the morning. When Daniel was nine, her father, a utility-company\nworker, was walking out of a bar in Baltimore when a convicted criminal with whom\nhe had a disagreement drew an assault rifle and shot him in the back at\npoint-blank range. “I did not and do not deserve to grow up in a world\nwithout my father because my country refuses to protect me,” she said.\nDaniel had asked DeSouza to stand next to her during the speech, and to\ntake over if she choked up. At one point she began to cry, but DeSouza\nrubbed her back, and, after wiping her cheeks, Daniel pushed through.\n“Maintaining that your Second Amendment rights are more important than\nmy right to live is absolute bullshit,” she said. “I refuse to live in a\nworld like this.”"]},

And yet President\nTrump’s formal announcement, last week, that he would authorize ", " on imported steel—a story that led the national news, and on which the\nfuture of the steel industry was said to hinge—caused no stir there.\nShifts began and ended. Barges continued to float down the Mississippi\nas usual, carrying tons of sorted scrap metal—cars and fridges and\nwashing machines, the residue of an earlier generation’s steelmaking—to\nthe terminals of the Nucor-Yamato plant, in Blytheville, and to the Big\nRiver Steel mill, in Osceola, and workers in each mill continued to melt\nthis junk down to make fresh steel, the first and main phase taking\nplace in electric arc furnaces that turn on with a bang so loud that\nanyone who hears it for the first time instinctively jumps. The furnaces\nrun at sixty hertz, and when you are inside the mills you can feel the\nvibrations in your body.", "Steel recycling of the kind that takes place in Mississippi County is a\nvisceral enterprise, in which the most apparently permanent material\nthat human beings have contrived to create is revealed to be mutable;\ninert steel is turned into a molten soup. “They say it’s the closest\nthing to hellfire on earth,” Dickie Kennemore, the longtime mayor of\nOsceola, a city of seventy-three hundred, explained to me when I visited\nhim in his office on Friday. Some fifteen hundred people now work in the\nsteel industry in Mississippi County, and although Kennemore isn’t in\nsteelmaking himself—he works as a realtor and insurance agent—his\nson-in-law works in management at the Big River Steel plant, and his\nneighbor is the plant’s C.E.O. Many people in Osceola are newly and\nintimately acquainted with the steel industry, a development for which\nKennemore himself is partly responsible. In the nineteen-nineties, he\nnoticed the jobs that two modern steel mills, owned by a company called\nNucor, had brought to Blytheville, twenty miles farther up the\nMississippi River, and he spent more than a decade trying to lure a\nsimilar facility to Osceola—using the city’s resources to buy a power\nplant so that it could sell electricity cheaply and preserving land by the\nriver for industry rather than residential development. In 2013, when a\nformer Nucor executive named John Correnti toured the state to lobby\nlegislators for a hundred and forty million dollars in tax breaks to\nbuild the Big River Steel plant, Kennemore went with him. The company’s\npromise was that the new mill’s salaries would average seventy-five\nthousand dollars; after the tax concessions were signed and the plant\nbegan operations, the real average turned out to be about ninety\nthousand dollars, in a city where only a few houses might sell for more\nthan two hundred thousand dollars. The new mill had not in any obvious\nway transformed the county—it is still poorer than the average in\nArkansas, which is among the poorest states in the nation—yet it had\nplainly provided the best jobs in the area.", "In the industrial suburbs of Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, and\nPittsburgh—the steel towns that house the older-style, unionized\nintegrated mills, where steel is still made fresh rather than\nrecycled—the President’s proposed tariff on steel imports, first\nannounced two weeks ago, occasioned a riot of attention. Reporters and\ntelevision cameras descended and came away with stories about how “steel\ntowns” were responding to Trump’s move. But two-thirds of American steel\nis now produced not in integrated mills but in smaller “minimills,” most\nof them non-union and located in the South, in places like Mississippi\nCounty, where the ancient process of using coke to melt iron ore has\nbeen replaced by a method in which electricity is used to melt scrap\nthat is then made back into steel of various forms. In these places, the\nnews of Trump’s tariffs caused no commotion at all. The newspapers and\ntelevision stations in Little Rock and Memphis did not dispatch\nreporters to Osceola, and politicians did not arrive at the gates of the\nmill to hold press conferences. “No one has mentioned the tariffs to me at all,” Kennemore told me. Mississippi County was full of country people, Kennemore said, who wanted to get away to hunt, to fish, to raise a garden. “We haven’t developed the attitude yet that we’re a steel town.” Employees in the mill mostly work four\ndays on, four days off, and many of them commute from far away. When I\nwent by the mill, a young man in a new BMW 3 Series took a turn hard\njust ahead of me and then careened down the road and through the\nemployee gate, headed for shift work at a non-union job that paid\nimpossibly well in an industry that most people understood to be union\nand dying.", "The allure of steel is in the permanence it can convey—in the material\nitself, but also in the idea that its jobs can be transferred from\nfathers to sons, that they are part of the landscape in a way that only\nold-economy jobs can be. We talk of steel towns, but never of nursing\ntowns, or I.T. towns. Economic protectionism is as close as Trump gets\nto a core political belief—he’s been arguing for it", " since the\nnineteen-eighties—and the verb in his campaign slogan, “Make America Great\nAgain,” was a subtle reference to manufacturing, a suggestion that the\npresent economy was an aberration and the mid-century version the\nnatural state. When President Trump announced the outlines of his tariff\nproposal, the general consensus was that it would make things worse for\nboth consumers and other industries, whose costs would rise. (A hundred\nand seven Republican members of Congress signed a letter to Trump urging\nhim to reconsider.) But the policy did have a few supporters, among them\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a popular Democrat from Ohio and a possible 2020\nPresidential candidate, who said that Trump’s decision would protect\n“steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims\nof Chinese cheating.” Last Wednesday, U.S. Steel announced that it would\nreopen a blast furnace at its mill in Granite City, Illinois, an old\nunionized facility that had been essentially shuttered for more than two\nyears. The steel story, as it took shape, illustrated the classic\nconflict between concentrated and diffuse interests. The tariffs would\nprobably make life a little worse for vast numbers of people. But they\nwould make life much better for about seven hundred and fifty very\nspecific people, all of them in the same place, a suburb of St. Louis.", "I arrived in Granite City last Thursday, a day after U.S. Steel made its\nannouncement. Inside the plant, workers were cleansing machines of what\nI was told were considerable layers of dirt and grime. But the main\naction was down the street, at the headquarters of United Steelworkers\nLocal 1899, whose president is Dan Simmons, a fifty-eight year-old with\nstiffened, side-parted hair. A pipe fitter by training, and the son of the\nplant’s foreman, Simmons first went to work at Granite City when he\nfinished high school, forty years ago. His face and disposition\n(profane, upbeat, cynical) slid naturally, on television, into a\nviewer’s idea of a steelworker. A reporter and photographer from the\n", " were outside his door, and Simmons had several\nmessages from a producer with Fox News. Things had recently grown so\ngrim in Granite City that Local 1899 was forced to set up for its\nmembers a weekly food pantry, which Simmons said had “good utilization.”\nNow, he said, the mood was “ecstatic.” Safety-recertification classes\nwere being organized, shifts arranged. Simmons was asked if he trusted\nthat the President would actually follow through with the tariffs.\nSimmons rolled his eyes. “The guy’s goofy enough that he may say, ‘What tariffs?’ ‘I never said tariffs,’ ” Simmons said. “Who knows where this fucking goes.”", "From a distance, the decline in the Northern steel industry has seemed\nas steady and predictable as a curve on a graph. The convenient\npolitical enemy has been foreign producers, but they are probably\nnot the real culprit. During the period (from the late sixties through\nthe turn of the millennium) when employment in the steel industry\nshrivelled to a fifth of its former scale, the Duke University economist Allan Collard-Wexler explained to me, foreign imports increased by only about ten per cent. But, at the same time, production was shifting from the\nold coal-powered integrated plants to the new electric minimills in the\nSouth, which were more efficient and better able to respond to\nfluctuations in demand. The decline of steel, Collard-Wexler said, was not the story of international competition but of the minimills. That the minimills were new also meant that their workforce was\nyounger and cheaper—the great trick of intra-industry competition. U.S.\nSteel, whose business model still depends on the integrated steel mills,\nspends about a quarter of its budget on labor; Nucor, the pioneering\nminimill firm (and now the country’s largest steelmaker) spends about a\ntenth. The iconography of the great, declining Midwestern steel town has\nbeen so frequently broadcast that there is a general impression that the\nregion is practically littered with isolated plants like Granite City\nWorks, which dictated the fate of a town and where sons followed fathers into steelwork. But there are only nine integrated steel mills left in the country, and nearly all of them are in the industrial suburbs of big\nMidwestern cities, where large economies can absorb the steelworkers’\nchildren, if not always the steelworkers themselves.", "When Granite City Works closed, in 2015, Simmons had thought that it\nwould reopen quickly, and he never really abandoned that conviction.\nOnce the two-year mark passed (when even those steelworkers with twenty\nyears of service lost their benefits), Simmons had an eye on the orders\ncoming in to U.S. Steel, and he thought that a reopening was imminent,\neven without the tariffs. He said, “We watch the numbers, too.”", "Meanwhile, his membership had come to other conclusions. Since 2015,\nmany members of Local 1899 had taken jobs as truck drivers or retrained\nas I.T. specialists. Those jobs paid lower wages and little of the\nalchemic magic of hot-metal work, but they did not seem like they\nwere going to disappear anytime soon. Last week, the steelworkers who\nwanted to come back to their jobs were calling a small, loquacious man\nnamed Jim Patton, who, like Simmons, was also in his fortieth year on\nthe job, and who coördinated the union’s safety training. But Patton\nsaid that he was also hearing from steelworkers who had taken jobs as\ntruckers, or in construction, and said", " that they were not coming back.\nFor them, the job had become simply “too unpredictable,” Patton said. In\nhiring, the union contract gave a special advantage to the relatives of\nsteelworkers, and that is why both Patton and Simmons had been able to\nstart work at eighteen—their fathers had worked in the mill. But\nPatton’s stepson had not become a steelworker, and neither had Simmons’\nsons. The steelworkers had no illusions that the jobs were permanent;\nthey had not planned their lives that way. I was talking with Patton in\nthe office of another union official, who had posted a large, formal\npicture of his own son, taken at his place of employment. The son is a\ndoctoral student in political science at Vanderbilt. He studies\nelectoral reform.", "There are some structural reasons (the river, rail lines, anti-union\nlaws) why the steel industry might situate itself in Mississippi County,\nArkansas, but the story told locally is that it was largely the work of\na single man, John Correnti (“Mr. Correnti”), who had built the first\nmills in Blytheville as an executive with Nucor and had then returned in\nthe early years of this decade to build a new independent mill, Big\nRiver Steel, with financing that he assembled on his own. Correnti had a\nrefrain that still gets quoted: “You give me farm boys and I’ll turn\nthem into steelworkers.”", "Mississippi County had plenty of farm boys. Politically, the county\nbelongs to Arkansas, but by culture it is part of the Delta. A whole\nlineage of great bluesmen came from the area, most famously Albert King,\nwho drove a bulldozer in Osceola during the week and then travelled to\nMemphis to play in clubs on the weekends. Twenty miles west of Osceola is\nDyess, an empty Depression-era village and the site of the childhood\nhome of Johnny Cash, whose family owned a small cotton farm. The county\nis thirty-five per cent black and sixty-one per cent white, and for most\nof the twentieth century, Mayor Kennemore explained, its economy had\nbeen agrarian, post-sharecropper. Families tended to own small plots out\nin the country—maybe forty acres, maybe eighty—and make what extra\nincome they could by working seasonally at the large cotton plantations\nor in the gins. The money from that work might have been essential,\nKennemore said, but for most people it did not alter their identity. An\neconomist might have categorized the people of Mississippi County as\npart-time industrial workers or hired farmhands. But by and large they\nsaw themselves as farmers.", "Correnti had envisioned Big River Steel as an impeccably modern mill, a\nkind of capstone project. He developed it in partnership with a San\nFrancisco artificial-intelligence startup called Noodle.ai, and it was\neventually equipped with fifty thousand sensors (a pioneering level of\ninstrumentation, Chris Pistorius, a steel engineer at Carnegie Mellon, explained to me) to allow for constant electronic monitoring. Perhaps one reason that Correnti had been so sure that he could turn farm boys\ninto steelworkers was that he understood how, in these new mills,\nmachines would do most of the work.", "Correnti died in 2015, a few months before Big River Steel opened. (“A\nborn manager,” the ", " reported in its\n", ".)\nThe project of turning farm boys into steelworkers fell to the\nworkforce-development professionals at Arkansas Northeastern College.\nWhat Big River Steel wanted from most of its new workers, Gene Bennett,\nthe vice-president for workforce development at Arkansas Northeastern,\nexplained to me, was a “rudimentary” set of skills—for them to be able\nto recognize basic tools and be able to use a computer. The mill was\nnot looking for expertise in steelwork so much as a more basic and\ntransferrable characteristic: a work ethic. When Kennemore toured the\nmill, he thought that it did not look much like a steel mill at all. The\nelectric arc furnace was operated by a few men sitting in an\nair-conditioned booth, pushing a button. The mill was full of young men\nmonitoring the sensors on hand-held devices, “like kids playing a video\ngame on their phones.”", "Kennemore spoke with me in his mayoral office, which is located in the corner of\na building that had once been a bank. His grandfather had been a\nsharecropper in the area and his father was an insurance agent, and\nKennemore was first elected to his office in 1990, when the local\neconomy was bottoming out and there was nothing around to sell or\ninsure. The county’s slow recovery had been built on industry: the steel\nmills and a few smaller, associated operations, and a factory for\nAmerican Greetings, which employed twelve hundred people to make\ngreeting cards.", "We had been talking for a while when we were joined by a quiet man named\nJoe Harris, a former Arkansas state representative and a hauling\ncontractor who had helped the city lobby in Little Rock for the steel\nmill. Harris is a black Democrat and Kennemore is a white Republican, but\nit turned out that they had been friends as boys. Harris and Kennemore’s\nbrother had trained pigeons together in the barns around Osceola. Only\nabout thirteen per cent of the county’s population has a bachelor’s\ndegree; Harris thought that might change now that people had a bit more\nmoney to pay for education. Steel was still hard and nonautonomous work,\nhe pointed out, and together he and Kennemore started to tick", " off the\nmen they knew who were already planning a way out, or had achieved it. One was working selling farm equipment, another was remodelling old houses. “They quit and they get their pot of money and they do something they enjoy more,” Kennemore said. Harris said that the younger steelworkers they knew took the jobs expecting that they might work for a decade and proceed to an early retirement. They did not talk about steelwork as a career, but as something more contingent and fleeting: an opportunity.", "The story of the U.S. steel industry is still set in the North, even as the mills themselves have moved South, and so it sustains a nostalgia that the industry itself cannot. In politics, the steel industry has come to stand in for a certain twentieth-century economic model, in which skilled industrial jobs could last a career and sustain a middle-class life. But that model did not survive the transition to the South—the work has grown less dangerous but also more automated. It is no longer skilled labor, and in this way, it does not seem so different from the work that might have been done in the cotton gins of the Arkansas delta fifty years ago. In the Midwest, the industrial twentieth century had been so influential that it seemed to form the permanent shape of the place. Elsewhere, blink and you’d miss it."]},

The Kochs’ record reveals that\ntheir financial support “comes with strings,” he said.", "The Kochs have recently given more than ten million dollars to Wichita\nState, in addition to their basketball donations; students joke that the\nschool should be renamed Koch State.

Brownback’s\nsingle-biggest campaign contributor, throughout his career: Koch\nIndustries, which also funded a midterm campaign against his opponents\nin the legislature. As governor, Brownback appointed Wichita State’s\nboard of trustees. (His term ended in January.)

(An intelligence official defended\nPompeo, saying he was only making use of space where intelligence\nofficers prepare for the President’s Daily Brief, a standard practice.)", "Under normal circumstances, Pompeo would have stopped attending the\nP.D.B. once Dan Coats, Trump’s nominee to serve as D.N.I., was confirmed\nby the Senate. But the ambitious spymaster managed to stay at Trump’s\nside throughout his thirteen-month tenure as the C.I.A. director, inflating his role in the process. Under U.S. law, the\nD.N.I. serves as the President’s principal intelligence adviser and\noversees the P.D.B., a summary of the most sensitive intelligence\ncollected by U.S. spy agencies. But at times, Pompeo acted as though he\nwere in charge, repeatedly making the false claim that he personally\ndelivered the P.D.B. to Trump. In reality, one of Coats’s deputies\nverbally presented the P.D.B. to Trump in the Oval Office. Coats,\nPompeo, and as many as ten other top Presidential advisers listened in.", "Pompeo’s defenders say he didn’t mean to elbow the D.N.I. out of the\nway. Rather, officials say, Pompeo hit the ground running before Coats\ncould get in place, and then successfully “managed” the President, in\ncontrast to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired this week,\nand other senior national-security officials who were perceived within\nthe White House as disloyal and contemptuous. Being an able politician,\nPompeo grabbed the spotlight, increasing his standing in Trump’s mind,\nthey say. Critics inside the Administration accused him of\nattention-getting and self-aggrandizement.", "Many C.I.A. officers had mixed feelings about Pompeo’s choices and\naggressive style but, as time went by, told me they came to believe that\nhe used his close relationship with Trump to protect the spy agency from\nTrump’s wrath. (Before he took office, Trump lashed out at the C.I.A.\nand other intelligence agencies for concluding that Russia had\nintervened in the 2016 election to help him win the White House. Since\ntaking office, Trump has generally been supportive of the C.I.A., in\ncontrast to his open hostility to the F.B.I., which is spearheading the\nRussia investigation.)", "By all accounts, Pompeo relished being a spymaster. But he often acted\nas though the role was too constraining. He wasn’t supposed to weigh in\non political or policy matters in White House meetings but did so\nfrequently, often at Trump’s request. At times, Pompeo pitched covert\nC.I.A. operations to the President without being asked to prepare them,\nbreaking with protocol.", "In some national-security Cabinet meetings, Pompeo made pronouncements\nabout alleged Iranian misconduct that other officials said weren’t\nbacked up by intelligence-community assessments, according to officials\npresent. “Pompeo couldn’t help himself,” one official said. “He’s a\npolitical animal who acts as if he wants to run for President some day.”\nOne of his early battles in the job was over installing new TVs in the\ndirector’s office at C.I.A. headquarters, possibly so he could keep up\nwith Fox News and other channels. C.I.A. security officers initially\nbalked at the request, arguing that the wiring could pose an\ninfiltration threat, but Pompeo insisted, according to one official\nbriefed on the exchange.", "What did Pompeo accomplish during his thirteen months at Langley? He\nquietly reversed Obama Administration edicts limiting the C.I.A.’s role\nin strikes by American drones, fuelling tensions with the Pentagon. He\ncast WikiLeaks as a hostile non-state foreign-intelligence service, and\npressed the White House for permission to take action against the group\nand its supporters for publishing C.I.A. hacking tools. While Pompeo has\nmade it a top priority to rebuild the C.I.A.’s capabilities to collect\nintelligence in Russia, the White House has so far balked at authorizing\nan aggressive covert campaign to punish Moscow for its interference in\nthe 2016 election. (On Thursday, the White House announced additional\nsanctions.)", "Pompeo’s hard-charging attitude, and his willingness to take risks and\ndelegate authority, made him especially popular with some officers in\nthe C.I.A.’s Directorate of Operations, known as the D.O., which carries\nout covert operations. Some undercover operatives had long complained of\nbeing micromanaged by what they saw as a risk-averse Obama White House.\nOther intelligence officials told me they sighed with relief when they\nlearned that Pompeo was leaving the post and that Trump was nominating\nGina Haspel, who came up in the Directorate of Operations, as the new\ndirector.", "Some Democratic lawmakers and human-rights groups\nhave criticized Haspel’s role in post-9/11 programs that employed\ntorture against suspected terrorists. Aides said that Democratic senators\nwould aggressively question Haspel during her confirmation hearings about her participation in the\nprograms.", "Inside Langley, however, many officers took solace in Trump choosing a\ncareer intelligence officer, who will likely play a more traditional\nrole than Pompeo had. “The program was abhorrent and inconsistent with our values, and I understand that senators facing her nomination will ask a number of tough questions and why a human-rights organization would object,” a former intelligence officer who served in the Obama Administration, and who supports Haspel’s nomination, said. “But I", " think she is highly qualified, and moreover, I think she would stand up and say no if Trump tries to do this again.”", "Whatever her baggage, at least she’s “one of us,” another intelligence\nofficer said."]},

The\nbook’s postscript goes up through the 2008 election, when Al Lamberti,\nwho was appointed to the position after federal corruption charges\nbrought down his predecessor, held off a Democratic challenger named\nScott Israel.", "Israel was elected four years later, and he was still in office on Valentine’s Day, when a nineteen-year-old named Nikolas Cruz took\nan AR-15 to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which is located in\nBroward County, and killed seventeen people.

The crime rate in Broward County dropped during Israel’s first\nterm, and he won reëlection handily in 2016. But, during the last two\nweeks, in conversations with multiple former colleagues and associates\nof Sheriff Israel, I was told again and again that, since taking office,\nIsrael has failed to engage sufficiently in the essential if unglamorous\nwork of overseeing law enforcement in a large and complex U.S. county,\nand that he was overly focussed on the politics of prolonging his tenure.\n(Israel’s public-information officer, when presented with a list of\nclaims made by people I’ve spoken to, described them as “shameful,\nbaseless, and patently false.”) Those concerns have deepened since the\nStoneman Douglas shooting. Jeff Bell, president of the Broward County\nSheriff’s Deputies Association and a deputy, who has been with the\nB.S.O. for twenty-two years, said, “We feel like we’ve been deserted. A\nship at sea, just drifting. No sense of direction whatsoever.” A former\nsenior employee of the B.S.O., who asked not to be named, told me, of Israel, “If\nhe survives this, morale will never be the same. And it’s already as bad\nas it’s ever been.”", "Some of Israel’s harshest critics are among those who worked to get him\nelected. Before seeking the office, Israel, who’s from New York, had\nbeen chief of police for tiny North Bay Village, in Miami-Dade County.\nHe had also been a Republican—he switched parties in order to run in\nBroward, which is historically Democratic. Judith Stern was Israel’s\ncampaign manager in 2008. “We had a lot of work to do to get him\nappropriately ready as a candidate,” she told me. “He wasn’t a brain\nguy. He was a cop who was generally liked by other cops. So we made sure\nto surround him with real law-enforcement pros, to educate him.” But\nStern ultimately came to believe that Israel was opportunistic and\nwould say what people wanted to hear in order to get elected. Stern,\nlike Israel, is Jewish, and she was surprised, she said, to\nlearn that he did not regularly attend synagogue. “I’m like, ‘That jerk.\nI’ve been going around talking to rabbis about your Jewishness!’”\n(Broward has one of ", " in the U.S.) Stern described Israel", " as someone who “believes in his own\nego.

In 2011, he called Israel “", ".”\n(He supported Lamberti in 2008.) The next year,\nhe helped get Israel elected. After he won, a former B.S.O. commander\nnamed Sam Frusterio, who acted as Israel’s campaign treasurer during his\nfirst bid but supported his opponent in 2012, filed an ethics-committee\ncomplaint against him for illegal acceptance of gifts.

Israel\ncharacterized Frusterio, at the time, as ", ".\nFrusterio, who is now seventy-two and living in Bluffton, South\nCarolina, told me that his concerns about Israel began during the first\ncampaign. “As time went on, I realized this guy was power-hungry and\ndidn’t care who he stepped on or what he did to get there,” he said.", "The former senior B.S.O. employee, who worked at the sheriff’s office\nfor decades, had other complaints about Israel. “We never talked about\ncrime,” he said. He added, “We had monthly crime meetings with the\ndistrict folks, but Israel never sat in and talked to us about it—not a\nburglary, not a robbery—never.” Instead, he said, Israel preferred to\ndiscuss community events. “He wanted to make sure we had all the parades\nand block parties covered. Even during hurricane season, the guy never\nsat us down and said, ‘O.K., where are we with the hurricane plan?’ ”\nIsrael, he said, “was more interested in branding, putting his picture\non the side of trucks. He’d say, ‘I’m the most visible sheriff ever.’\nI’d be visible, too, if I never came in the office. The guy didn’t spend\ntwenty hours a week there.” A deputy who currently works at the B.S.O.\nalso could not recall “ever hearing Israel talk in detail about crime.”", "Other people who worked in the sheriff’s office described Israel as “a\nhothead” and “crazy,” someone who would scream at them one minute and a\nfew minutes later act as though nothing had happened. “We all felt like\nwe were walking on eggshells with Israel, because you never knew what\nmood you were going to get,” Phyllis Massey Lind, a former B.S.O.\nexecutive assistant who worked for Israel and who still lives and works\nin Broward County, said. Lind told me that the two sheriffs who preceded\nIsrael seemed much more confident in their work.", "“This Sheriff has refused to accept responsibility numerous times, in\nnumerous settings,” Lamberti, who lost to Israel in a four-way race in 2012, told me. “Leadership 101 is: the\nboss is responsible for everything,” Lamberti added. “The very first\nlawsuit filed, his name is going to be at the top. When I was Sheriff,\nan inmate in the jail didn’t like the food and I got sued for that.”\nScot Peterson, the deputy who was outside of Stoneman Douglas during the\nshooting, has ", ",\nthough, so far,\n", " and video seem to back up Israel’s account.

But two of these calls, received in\nFebruary of 2016 and November of 2017, are still under internal\ninvestigation and review.", "“In defense of the guys who take the calls, there’s thousands of them,”\nLamberti told me. “You just have to identify which are serious and which\nare bogus. We have to do better at that, in my opinion.” Nearly everyone\nI talked to was unsurprised by Israel’s apparent resistance, in the wake\nof the Parkland shooting, to take similar responsibility. (When the CNN\nhost Jake Tapper asked Israel, on February 25th, whether his office\ncould have done anything to prevent the shooting, Israel replied,\n“Listen, ", ",\nO. J. Simpson would still be in the record books.”) Through the public-information officer, Israel said, “I am responsible for the safety of\nthe nearly two million residents of Broward County, for the almost 5,400\nemployees of the Broward Sheriff’s Office and for ensuring that if any\nfailures occur, they are appropriately addressed so they never happen\nagain.”", "The former senior employee pointed to another major incident, from\nJanuary of 2017, when a man with a gun killed five people at Fort\nLauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. It remains one of the\ndeadliest airport shootings in U.S. history. The perpetrator was\narrested in under two minutes, but, as the ", " reported, “a\nflurry of false reports of gunshots ninety minutes later—", ", within earshot of passengers—sparked an uncontrolled, mass evacuation\nfrom all four airport terminals.” A report compiled by an independent\nconsulting company later concluded that “", ".”\nLaw enforcement, the report said, “lacked clear instructions, objectives\nand roles.” Israel disputed the report before reading it. “Lessons\nshould have been learned,” the former senior employee told me. “But they\nweren’t. They just aren’t under Israel.”", "Lamberti said that it was essential that sheriffs’ offices study what\nhas gone wrong in the past. After other mass shootings, he said, “we\nalways tried to send people out there, get people on the phone. To learn\nfrom these things.” Procedures changed after the Columbine shooting, he\nnoted, because it was all over so quickly. Now, he said, “you go in and\nengage the shooter immediately, with ideally four officers. But you go\nin with one, if necessary. You don’t wait.”", "“This school shooting was a failure of protocol and procedures,” he\nadded. “The red flags were there. The signs that were out there about\nthis guy. We didn’t connect the dots.

The University of Maryland, Baltimore County Retrievers beat\nthe University of Virginia Cavaliers by an astounding twenty points,\nmeaning that by the time the horn sounded, there were no screaming announcers, no center-court pileup, no players crying tears of\nastonished joy.

The point is to portray Putin as a\nbenevolent and omniscient national leader, a figure above the messiness\nof governance, not so much a President as a tsar, who, when the\nsovereign so wishes, grants the people an audience to air their\nquotidian problems and concerns.", "It is exactly this aura—of a man in a technically political post who\nexists outside of politics—that Putin carries into Sunday’s Presidential\nelections, when he will most certainly gain another six-year term in the\nKremlin. For Putin, already eighteen years in power, elections are a\ntechnical task, a periodic necessity, and a kind of referendum for his\nrule. The choice as presented isn’t really between Putin and others but\nbetween Putin and the void, the nonexistent, and the unimaginable. As\nsuch, Putin doesn’t deign to carry himself like a candidate: this\nelectoral cycle, as always, he did not participate in televised debates,\nand, this time around, he even declined to be filmed or lend his voice\nto his campaign’s official advertisements.", "Instead, Putin relies on the episodic theatre of events like his call-in\nshow on state-run television, a safe environment where there are no\nchallengers, and no hint that anyone else could ever manage to rule such\na large, difficult, madcap country. The most recent call-in show, known\nas the “Direct Line with Vladimir Putin,” was held in June. Toward the\nend of the four-hour session, the hosts handed the microphone to a\nhigh-school student named Danila Prilepa, from Nefteyugansk, a midsize\ncity some seventeen hundred miles east of Moscow.", "“Hello, Mister President,” Danila began. “The fact that corrupt\nofficials and ministers are in the government is not news, and has not\nbeen for a long time; putting them under house arrest for show does not\nproduce results, and you undermine people’s trust by doing so.” Danila,\nwho was sixteen years old at the time, went on to say that such\n“negligence” affects the majority of the population, including his\nfather, who had served for many years in the Interior Ministry, Russia’s\nnational police force. Danila said that his family—because of his\nfather’s job— should be entitled to a subsidy for the purchase of an\napartment. But, in Danila’s region, from a waiting list of thousands,\nonly ninety families have received the requisite funds over the last\nfive years.", "Putin saw that Danila had read his question from a piece of paper. He\nasked if he had thought it up himself, or “Did someone prepare it for\nyou?” Danila was quick in his reply: “Life has prepared me for this\nquestion.” Putin went on to give an answer that was meant to sound\nconvincing, but was lacking in specifics; he vaguely promised to\nincrease housing funds in Danila’s region, and claimed that the\ncountry‘s judges, not its President, control the sentencing of corrupt\nofficials.", "It was a rare moment of unscripted—uncomfortable, even—humanity in an\notherwise listless ritual. The dialogue also captured a sense of the\nbubbling discontent among Russia’s young people, a generational shift\nthat is one of the few dynamic stories in a preëlection season that is\notherwise denuded and predictable. (The Kremlin’s main worry for\nSunday’s vote is not whether Putin will win but whether enough people\nwill bother to vote at all, making the real battle over insuring a\nrespectable-looking turnout.)", "Much has been written, ", ", of the support among Russian\nyoung people for Alexey Navalny, an opposition politician who drew\nthousands to rallies across the country last year, and is Putin’s most\nacute challenger. He was kept off the Presidential ballot. Danila’s\nconfident and unblinking demeanor in the face of the very quintessence\nof authority seemed to crystallize deeper social changes among those who\nare known as the Putin generation: the millions of Russians now coming\nof age who have known no other leader of their country. (", ", in a revealing series of oral histories and photographic\nportraits, dubbed them the “", ".”)", "Earlier this week, I travelled to Nefteyugansk, a compact and prim city\nof a hundred and twenty thousand people, carved out of the snow-covered\noil fields of western Siberia. It was founded in the nineteen-sixties,\nwhen Soviet geologists discovered vast oil deposits nearby. These days,\nNefteyugansk retains something of the feeling of a Soviet planned town,\nbut of the more charming variety: a wide thoroughfare or two that\nintersect the city center, a number of public squares, low-slung\napartment buildings arranged around open courtyards. Newly built\nresidential high-rises dot the town’s otherwise unbroken horizon, fading\noff into the distance to an icy white haze.", "I met Danila in a café in a single-story shopping center not far from\nhis family’s new apartment—they never did get their promised\nstate-subsidized housing, and, not long ago, bought a new place by\ntaking out a mortgage. Danila, now sixteen years old, has a curled wave\nof brown hair, and a smile that is both earnest and polite.", "For several", " years, after school, he studied aeronautics and worked on\ndesigning drones at a nearby “technopark”—it was a congress of similar\nyouth-engineering centers from around the country that brought him to\nMoscow last summer. On their second night in the capital, after a tour\nof the skyscrapers at the Moscow City complex, and a visit to the graves\nof famous historical figures at Novodevichy Convent, organizers told\nthem that they would be in the audience of Putin’s direct line the next\nday. They asked if anyone had a question to ask the President. Danila\nsaid yes, in fact he did, and explained the general contours of what he\nwanted to say.", "On the morning of the show, buses brought Danila and the other students\nto the studio. “We were thrilled that we would get to see the\nPresident,” he remembers. Ten minutes before the program’s start, Danila\nwas told he would be asking his question. He took out a notepad and\nstarted to draft a text of what he wanted to say; he had just finished\nwriting when the show’s hosts told him that it was his turn.", "His retort to Putin was simply an “impulse of the soul,” he told me. “I\ndidn’t think for a second, I didn’t expect this from myself—but later, I\nrealized it was the most correct thing I could have said.”", "The exchange left him feeling dissatisfied, though. He had asked the\nPresident a serious question, and even though Danila might be a kid, he\nwanted a forthright answer. Instead, Danila thought, Putin “took it as a\njoke, he jumped off in a different direction—I expected more.” As Danila\nput it to me, “I may be young, but I have eyes, and ears, and can make\nsome conclusions; not just out of nowhere, either, but based on a real\nsituation my family is facing.”", "For a while after his appearance, Danila enjoyed—or, rather, endured—a\nsort of micro-celebrity. Journalists from just about every television\nchannel in Russia, including all the main state networks, wanted to\ninterview him, and he got non-stop messages on his social-media pages.\nPeople around town came up and asked to take a photograph with him. “It\nwas awkward,” he said. At one point, Danila went to his family’s dacha\noutside of town, and stopped checking his phone. One teacher at school\ncriticized his tone with Putin, suggesting that the President has more\nimportant business than the minutiae of Danila’s concerns.", "Still, Danila doesn’t consider himself particularly politically\nengaged—curious, but not all that passionate. He rarely watches\ntelevision and gets most of his news, especially on political topics,\nfrom various feeds on Telegram, a popular messaging app, and the\ninterview series of Yury Dud, a popular video blogger who puts frank and\nprobing questions to Russian entertainers and public figures. Danila is\nsympathetic to Navalny and follows his initiatives. A local supporter,\nwhom Danila doesn’t know, had tried to organize a pro-Navalny rally in\ntown last spring, but withdrew his application once he said his\nrelatives had come under pressure. Danila said he would have gone, if\nsuch a protest had taken place; and, if he was old enough to vote and\nNavalny was on the ballot, would probably support him.", "“I’m not saying that everything is so terrible in our country, but\nstill, somehow, you want more,” Danila told me. He started to talk about\nhow researchers at Harvard had recently tested a prototype of a cancer\nvaccine on mice. “I want this in my country also. We have the resources\nto allow for it, they just aren’t put in the right direction,” he said.\nSometimes, he told me, it can feel like Russia has become “stuck in\nplace.” He was frustrated and wanted better from his country, but in all\nmy conversations with Danila, he never sounded emotional or aggrieved,\nand certainly not revolutionary. “As long as I can remember, I’ve\nbasically been happy.”", "Perhaps, like Danila himself, his home town is a stand-in for the arc of\nthe post-Soviet era. In the nineties, after the Soviet collapse, the\nmain oil-production facility in town was acquired by Mikhail\nKhodorkovsky, who took over Yukos, the formerly state-owned oil company,\nwhen it was privatized. With time, Khodorkovsky would be known for his\nclash with Putin, the ten years he served in a Russian prison, and his\npolitical activism from his new home in London—but, back in the mid- and\nlate nineties, he was a calculating and not particularly munificent\nmember of the post-Soviet oligarchy.", "In 1998, protests erupted in Nefteyugansk over unpaid taxes, with locals\nupset at Yukos for withholding funds from the city budget. The\ndemonstrations, which drew tens of thousands of people, were led by the\ncity’s first democratically elected mayor, Vladimir Petukhov. At the\nheight of the anti-Yukos protests, in June, 1998, Petukhov was shot dead\nin a hail of submachine-gun fire. Later, after Putin’s rise and\nKhodorkovsky’s fall from influence, the case was revived in an attempt\nto pin the murder on Khodorkovsky’s associates—like so much from the\nnineties, the actual truth is unlikely ever to surface.", "After Khodorkovsky was sent to prison on politically motivated tax\ncharges, and Yukos was dismantled, its assets in Nefteyugansk were taken\nover by Rosneft, a state oil giant now run by a close ally of Putin’s.\nThe company has an outsized footprint in the city, at once the largest\nsingle employer", " and benefactor. It gave funds for the construction of a\nnew kindergarten, an ice rink, and a giant indoor swimming pool and\nwater park. Each year, the company contributes an additional five\nmillion dollars to the city’s budget for social programs. It is a\ntempting allegory for the Putin era in microcosm: predatory, wildcat\ncapitalism was replaced by the soothing paternalism of state corporatism\nThat is the world that Danila and his generation have inhabited since\nbirth, in which the state is both omnipresent and immutable, as endemic\nas oxygen in the atmosphere. In a recent report on Russia’s post-2018\npolitics, the political scientists Ivan Krastev and Gleb Pavlovsky wrote\nthat, “contrary to Western fantasies, Russians under the age of 25 are\namong the most conservative and pro-Putin groups in society.” ", " last December, by the Levada Center, an independent polling\nagency, showed that Putin enjoyed eighty-six-per-cent approval among\nthose surveyed between eighteen and twenty-four years old, compared to\neighty-one per cent for the sample group as a whole. Of those young\npeople surveyed, sixty-seven per cent said they thought Russia was going\nin the right direction, compared to fifty-six per cent among the wider\ngroup.", "During my conversation with Danila, I asked him about his relationship\nwith his parents and the differences between how their generation views\nRussia and his own. He mentioned how he had read Ivan Turgenev’s\n“Fathers and Sons”—about the intergenerational understanding gap in the\neighteen-sixties—in school, several years ago, and it echoed his\nconversations at home. Danila never saw or lived through the age that\nproved most formative for his parents, the collapse of the Soviet Union;\nand the things that are most relevant for him, his parents don’t\nunderstand, and therefore often fear. He told me what he had heard about\nhis father’s childhood, in a farming village in the Caucasus. By the\ntime the Soviet Union disintegrated, so had the local economy, and\npeople were reduced to bartering fresh milk for eggs. As a boy, his\nfather couldn’t keep up in school because he was too busy tending to his\nfamily’s small plot of land.", "“They had their own worries,” Danila said. “At this moment, we, the new\ngeneration—if I may say so—have new needs.” But it has proved hard for\nDanila and his peers to concretize them, to turn that sentiment and\nenergy into something tangible. Danila brought up his own experience on\nPutin’s call-in show: “I tried, but it did not bear fruit, you could\nsay, proving once again that a pug and an elephant are not equal.”", "One afternoon, in Nefteyugansk, I stopped by something called the\n“center for youth initiatives,” a space for various artistic and civic\nprojects led by the city’s young people. I talked with a high-school\nsenior named Evgenia Merkulenko, who had raised two million rubles,\naround thirty-five thousand dollars, for the building of a new,\nspecially designed playground for disabled children, securing funds from\nvarious government offices and local businesspeople. She was buoyant\nabout life in Nefteyugansk, and Russia in general, a place, she said,\nwith “lots of ideas—you just have to develop them, and for that there\nare resources, there are opportunities.”", "Her positivity struck me as genuine, an optimism forged through what is\nknown in Russian as “social lift,” Putin-style—the benefits and\nresources the state can bestow on those with talent and ambition, and\nwhose goals fit with those of the system. “I know there was a time when\nnot everything worked so smoothly,” she told me. But now, “I’m confident\nin my country, we live calmly, and peacefully, life has a certain\nconsistency.”", "Merkulenko turned eighteen last month, and thus is eligible to vote in\nSunday’s election, her first. She was excited for the opportunity, and\nwhile she demurred when I asked whom she would vote for, it was clear\nthat she carried a great deal of esteem, even affection, for Putin. “I\nhave read a lot about him, he has advanced things a great deal,” she\nsaid. She admitted that, having been born in the first year of Putin,\nshe could not compare with other leaders, “but I’m fully satisfied,” she\nsaid.", "As we sat and talked, it was clear that, although her values were\ngenerally liberal—she spoke of the need for tolerance and the\nprotections of the law—her immediate political outlook was, by\ndefinition, conservative: the Putin system suited her just fine, and she\nwas loath to do anything to rock it. “I can’t see anything that is\nnecessary to change,” she said, “because right now, as I can see, there\nalready is everything.”", "Later, I made my way to a garage for a youth motocross club, where a\nletter posted on the door, signed by a local official in town, intrigued\nme. “Colleagues! Friends!” it began. Upcoming elections are taking place\nunder “strong external pressure,” it warned, and to demonstrate\n“patriotism and rallying together,” each and every person must vote on\nSunday. “Only in this way will we prove that we cannot be broken with\nsanctions and threats.”", "I ended up talking with a number of young men who were members of the\nmotocross club. They said that they were planning to vote, not because\nRussia is threatened by would-be enemies—they thought that idea strange\nand unconvincing, and hadn’t really paid the letter much attention until\nI brought it up.", "Maxim, who is nineteen, said that he", " would have voted for Navalny were\nhe on the ballot, but seeing as he had been barred, he was thinking of\nsupporting Putin. I was confused, and asked how he could so easily shift\nhis support from the figure who took on the system, to the one who\npersonified it. He tried to explain the paradox, which actually made\nperfect sense to him. “It’s like this,” he said. His first choice would\nbe to see political change, but, he said, “those who have prospects are\ntaken out because they represent competition. The ones those are left\nare accustomed to it, they’ve settled in—and they create stability.”\nAnd, as he put it, “actually, I am not against this stability. At least\nfor things not to get worse.”", "It struck me as a telling bit of political wiliness, and as good a\ndescription of the Putin generation as any: they are open, curious, and\nambitious, but not—at least not yet—desperate and insurrectionary. On my\nlast morning in Nefteyugansk, I took a stroll around town with Danila,\npassing his school, and a row of wooden apartment blocs built for the\ncity’s first residents, fifty years ago. The sun was out, ricocheting\nbrightly off the snow, and the temperature had climbed to five\ndegrees—delightful spring weather, Danila declared. We stopped to warm\nup with some tea.", "Danila told me that, as he understood from his father, in the Soviet\nUnion young people had a mania for everything foreign. Today, what’s\nfashionable is “success, having a better life.” Achievement is, in a\nword, cool—which perhaps explains the duality of being drawn to\nNavalny’s call for change and Putin’s promise of stability. We talked\nabout plans for the future. Danila has another couple of years left in\nschool, and then wants to enroll in a military aviation institute in\nsouthern Russia. He’d like to train as a pilot. I asked if he saw a\ndifficulty in serving a state he had begun to sour on. No, he said. “I’m\nplanning to serve my homeland, not a certain circle of people.” For as\nlong as Danila has been alive, those two things have fused together,\nseemingly inexorably. But there is one last, inarguable fact of the\nPutin generation: whatever Russia’s post-Putin future holds, they will\nbe the ones to inherit it."]},

At a meeting the previous day, some\nstudents expressed worry that the march’s message was too partisan.", "“These are my ", ",” González said to Jeffrey Foster, her A.P.\nGovernment teacher, who was there to answer questions from parents.\n“I’m, like, you can say whatever you want about whatever topic, I’m not\ntelling you what to say there, but make sure the message is cohesive.\nHere’s how I feel, and here is what goes through my head. You don’t have\nto listen to me on this, but if you want to help this is a really\nimportant way to help.”", "The gym had been stocked with pizzas, boxes of tissues, and coolers of\ndrinks. Students arrived, many of them accompanied by their parents, and\ntook their seats. González checked to make sure that bottles of water\nand paper plates had been put out. She wore a maroon sundress and pink\nsneakers. Less than two weeks before, I had watched as she sat at a\npicnic table and chose a Twitter handle. Now she had more than a million\nfollowers on Twitter—more, as many pointed out, than the N.R.A. But all\nof this had happened outside of school. I asked how it was to be back.", "“It’s pretty good,” she said. “And if news developments happen in the\nday—like today, when we found out about the shooting, my friend got\nupset, and I was immediately able to talk to her. I didn’t have to drive\nover to her house or run over there, like, she walked down the hallway\nand we were able to talk to each other. That’s nice. And the support\ndogs—have you heard about the support dogs?”", "The shooting that day had happened at Central Michigan University, where\na nineteen-year-old named James Eric Davis, Jr., had killed his parents,\nwho had arrived to pick him up for spring break. For González and the\nother students, the news of yet another act of gun violence on a campus\nhad renewed their sense of purpose but also their feeling of\npowerlessness.", "“It feels like we’re not getting anything done,” González said. “The\nwheels of bureaucracy turn so slowly that, no matter what we say and how\nmany people we get to sign petitions, we can’t vote anybody out until\nmidterm elections, which are so far away.” As February gave way to\nMarch, two points were proved about the gun-control debate: first, that\ncynicism about it was not unfounded; second, that, even as the students\nadvocated, the violence would not stop.", "To insure that students would be comfortable asking questions, the media\nwere not allowed to remain in the gym for the lecture, so, as González\ndimmed the lights and began her presentation, I stepped outside. Near\nthe entrance of the rec center, Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr, who had\nbeen among the students who went to Washington, D.C., earlier in the\nweek, sat at a table. Never Again had developed a platform, the main\ntenets of which Tarr read out to me from a yellow notebook with", " the\nwords “Anything Is Possible!” embossed on the cover in gold.", "“Of course, the assault-weapons ban is the most difficult, and that’s\nthe longest-term thing,” she said, flipping pages until she found her\nlist. “But now what we’re really getting into is universal background\nchecks. That would also entail closing the gun-show loopholes, closing\nstraw purchases, and instilling the red-flag system. We also want to get\nrid of high-capacity magazines, and we want to raise the age from\neighteen to twenty-one.” In Washington, particularly when talking to\npro-gun politicians, the students focussed their arguments on narrower\nproblems: the law that forbids the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,\nand Explosives from creating a searchable database; the Dickey\nAmendment, which prevents research that advocates or promotes gun\ncontrol; ", ", which allow a semiautomatic weapon to fire at a rapid clip. The students became increasingly adept at identifying\npolitical obfuscation: the congressman who might discuss “extensive\nbackground checks” rather than universal ones; the congresswoman who\nbrings up mental illness to change the subject from gun control. With\nSenator Charles Schumer, of New York, they discussed the flaws of the\nbackground-check system, and how to improve the original assault-weapons\nban, from 1994, which Schumer co-authored, and which the students think\ncould be more effective with the addition of a gun-buy-back program.", "I asked what it was like to go back to school. “Boring,” Deitsch said.\n“It’s been coloring and Play-Doh.” Classrooms had been supplied with\ngames and something called “kinetic sand” to ease the students’\nreëntry. “When you sit down with the Speaker of the House and then\nyou’re told to just play with a lump of clay, it’s not really\nstimulating.”", "The Speaker of the House, it turned out, had given the students some\npushback on their critique of the Dickey Amendment, and a hallway\nencounter with Congressman Darrell Issa, of California, had turned\ndownright contentious. The Democrats had been more amenable, but, after\nspeaking to them, the movement added another message. “We also wanted to\ntell them, ‘Listen, we’re so grateful for the help and everything, but\nwe’re not your pawns,’ ” Chris Grady, a Stoneman Douglas senior who went\non the trip, said later, after the meeting in the gymnasium. “Make no\nmistake about it: we’re our own movement.”", "The following evening, the second annual Obama Roosevelt Legacy Dinner,\nadvertised as one of the “premier events for the Broward County\nDemocratic Party,” was held at the Pier Sixty-Six Hotel, in Fort\nLauderdale. Valets waved attendees into parking lots that overlooked a\nmarina filled with gleaming white yachts. The dinner, tickets to which\ncost a hundred and seventy-five dollars or more, had been planned long\nin advance of the shooting, but the agenda had shifted. Bowls of ribbons\nin Stoneman Douglas colors were available for guests to pin to suit\nlapels and sequinned cardigans. The crowd was friendly, mostly over the\nage of forty, and clad in sensible shoes. The yachts outside likely\nbelonged to other people; Mar-a-Lago was a county away. Several Stoneman\nDouglas students had come to the fund-raiser, too, although not, they\nemphasized, to endorse a particular candidate. If anything, it was the\npoliticians who wanted their photos taken with the students. In their\ncocktail-hour soapbox speeches, the Democratic candidates for Florida’s\n2018 gubernatorial race emphasized their records and sentiments on gun\ncontrol. Afterward, a host encouraged guests to proceed to dinner in a\n“blue wave.”", "The national anthem was sung and the Pledge of Allegiance recited, and\nthen the ceremony began. The focus of the night was the violent act that\nhad happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and what to do\nabout it, as if the students had woken the politicians from a long\nenchanted slumber. There were only perfunctory mentions of health care,\nclimate change, or the tax cut that Republicans had passed earlier that\nyear. There was no mention of the resignations and allegations plaguing\nthe Trump Administration, which had shared the headlines with the\nshooting and its aftermath for the past two weeks.", "Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke of “the three-legged stool\non which future generations can build and thrive: faith, hope, and\ncourage.” Congressman Ted Deutch, at whose behest the students had\nvisited Washington, said “Never again can we fail to take action.”\nPhilip Levine, a candidate for governor, referred to to the students in\nattendance as “a new greatest generation right here.” Cynthia Busch, the\ncounty chairwoman, said that the Broward County e-mail list had tripled\nin the last week.", "“No more deals, no more compromises,” she promised. “We are here to\nfight.”", "The keynote speaker was Congressman Joseph Kennedy III, of Massachusetts.\nKennedy is a ginger who speaks in the short staccato bursts of his\ngreat-uncle and grandfather. At thirty-seven, he has been tapped by the\nParty as a rising star, not only because of his dynastic connections and\nhis relative youth but because of his ability to speak about important\nthings without sounding phony. Earlier in the year, he was selected to\ngive the Democratic Party’s response to Trump’s State of the Union\naddress. Now he issued a statement on an issue that, thanks to the\nrelentless activism of the students, was going to be decisive in the\nmidterm elections.", "Kennedy began with acknowledgments and a joke about his family’s love of\nFlorida. (“From what I can tell, President Kennedy didn’t get that winter\ntan ice fishing on", " Cape Cod.”) But he soon moved on to the heart of the\nmatter.", "“Our children wake up every morning in a country where nearly a hundred\nlives will be lost to guns by the time they go to bed, and they hear a\nRepublican Party say that that is the price of freedom,” he said.", "Kennedy recalled other instances of youth activism in American history:\nthe mill girls of Lowell in the mid-nineteenth century; the Little Rock\nnine, in 1957; the children who marched for civil rights in the\n“children’s crusade” and were arrested in Birmingham, in 1963; the four\nstudents killed by the National Guard at Kent State, in 1970. “From\nStonewall to Selma to Seneca Falls, America’s youth forces us to\nconfront where we have fallen short,” he said.", "He concluded with a promise that this time the adults would try harder.\n“Broward, have no doubt: our nation will follow you,” he said. “We will\nbe better than we were in Little Rock, and in Birmingham, and in Kent.\nWe will not force our kids to march alone. We will not tell them to do\nour government’s job.”", "Was the government doing its job? In Florida, the state legislature\npassed a bill—which now awaits the signature of the Florida governor, Rick\nScott—raising the age at which a person can buy an assault rifle to\ntwenty-one. It also allotted sixty-seven million dollars to train and\narm teachers, despite opposition from students and lawmakers who\npredicted that the policy would put more children, particularly African-American students, at risk. (There was also the opposition of Florida\nstate representative Elizabeth Porter, who asked, “Do we allow the\nchildren to tell us that we should pass a law that says no homework?”)\nIn the U.S. Senate, Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat,\nco-sponsored another bill raising age limits. The President expressed\nsupport for the idea, saying at a meeting with lawmakers that “It\ndoesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m twenty-one to get a\nhandgun but I can get this weapon at eighteen.” I thought back to what\nRyan Deitsch, the Never Again activist, had told me while sitting in the\nPine Trails Park rec center the day before: “Until the politicians vote\nand pass something, all of their words mean nothing. As soon as they’re\nshot down, it just means that everything we talked about, everything we\ndid in Washington, everything we did in Tallahassee amounts to nothing.\nAnd we choose to refuse that reality.”"]},

The invitation was relayed by a South Korean delegation that met with Kim earlier this week and then travelled to Washington. It will be the first-ever meeting between American and North Korean heads of state. The location is yet to be designated, but the odds are that it will be a South Korean or Chinese venue.", "Unless the summit is just an extraordinary photo opportunity to symbolize the easing of tensions or a simple listening tour, the new U.S.-North Korean track is backward diplomatically. A summit of leaders is usually the reward rather than the starting point. Normally, months or even years of diplomatic legwork are required to work out terms to be formally approved by heads of state. The Clinton Administration spent years working on phases of a deal to curtail North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, which included a trip by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang. A visit by President Clinton was supposed to be the final deal-maker.", "As it is currently set up, President Trump has everything to lose if he comes away without tangible and extensive gains that meet his long-standing demand for North Korea to abandon the world’s deadliest weapon. Kim, who leads the world’s most isolated country, has everything to gain from the stature that comes from a summit with the world’s leading superpower.", "North Korea’s wily charm offensive this year, and President Trump’s willingness to embrace it, are stunning reversals after a torrent of threats during the final months of 2017. At his United Nations début, in September, President Trump described Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a “suicide mission.” The United States would have “no choice but to totally destroy North Korea” if it had to defend itself or its allies, he said. Kim countered by labelling Trump a “", ".” The President’s speech “convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct, and that it is the one I have to follow to the last,” he said.", "In October, Trump tweeted, “I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man....” And just hours before the surprise announcement on Thursday, Tillerson told a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that the United States was “still a long ways from negotiations” with North Korea. “We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it.” The first step, he predicted, would be talks about talks.", "Trump’s historic decision unfolded in just a matter of hours—and it was also highly unusual. It followed a meeting with Chung Eui-yong, the national-security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. President Trump seemed so excited about his decision that he ducked into the White House press room to announce that the South Korean official would have an important statement at 7 ", "—but provided no details. Speaking at the press stakeout outside the White House, Chung told reporters, “I explained to President Trump that his leadership and his maximum pressure policy, together with international solidarity, brought us to this juncture.”", "In a statement, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the President “greatly appreciates the nice words” of the South Korean delegation. “We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.”", "The biggest unanswered question is what North Korea wants in exchange for scrapping its nuclear weapons. It could include an end to military exercises between the United States and South Korea, the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula, a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War, normalization of diplomatic relations, guarantees of non-aggression, an end to economic sanctions, and possibly economic aid.", "In some ways, it’s an offer—and an opportunity—that’s impossible to refuse. Diplomacy to eliminate the North’s weapons has been an American goal for more than two decades. President Trump is the latest in a long line of Presidents—dating back to Harry Truman—to navigate the enigmatic regime in North Korea, which has been ruled by three generations of the Kim dynasty for seven decades. In 1950, President Truman ", " his willingness to use an atomic bomb—“every weapon that we have”—against North Korea during the war to prevent Communist aggression on the South.", "At the same time, diplomacy has never fully succeeded, despite assorted pledges and pacts during the previous three Administrations. And the stakes today are much higher. “Diplomacy is much tougher now than it’s ever been because the North Koreans have nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them,” Wendy Sherman, who worked on the North Korea portfolio in the Clinton and Obama Administrations, told me. Sherman accompanied Albright to Pyongyang, in 2000, on the only trip made there by a ranking U.S. official since the end of the Korean War. (I was on that trip, too.)", "Last year alone, the North conducted more than two-dozen missile tests, including the test of a missile capable of reaching any part of the United States, and tested a hydrogen bomb—adding to its arsenal of atomic bombs. “The North Koreans have much more leverage than before,” Sherman", " said. “Comparisons to the past are useful but they’re not adequate for where we are right now.”", "American Presidents have long vowed to block proliferation of the world’s deadliest weapon. But brokering deals has consistently been their most frustrating foreign-policy challenge. In 1984, President Reagan bluntly warned Pakistan against developing a bomb. But it did, conducting its first nuclear test in 1998. President Clinton pledged that North Korea would not get the bomb “even at the risk of war.” But it did, conducting its first test in 2006. President George W. Bush vowed that Iran would not get the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. But it did, although U.S. intelligence believed it was still at least months away from a bomb when a nuclear deal was struck in 2015.", "The U.S. track record with North Korea is the longest and most tortured. The first breakthrough was in 1994, when the Clinton Administration brokered the ", ". North Korea promised to immediately freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program, which included two reactors under construction that Washington was concerned could produce fuel for a bomb. In turn, Pyongyang would receive energy substitutes—heavy fuel oil in the short-term and the eventual construction of two light-water reactors not able to produce fuel for a nuclear weapon.", "“North Korea did not produce one additional ounce of fissile material, no nuclear weapons and no ballistic missiles during the Clinton Administration,” Sherman said. But the deal proved to be too complex and time-consuming. “We moved very slowly on the Framework,” she said. “We didn’t realize how hard it was to do, so there were all kinds of problems and slowdowns. Using a [international] consortium to build and finance a [light-water] reactor was not easy. We also didn’t really move to normalize relations, which is what was expected by the North.” The deal also got caught up in domestic politics. The accord coincided with the 1994 Republican sweep of Congress, known as the Republican Revolution. “The Republicans never liked it anyway,” Sherman said.", "The agreement was also complicated when the North began testing ballistic missiles, in 1998. The Clinton Administration wanted to extend the Agreed Framework to include missiles. Albright travelled to Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il, in 2000, hoping to pave the way for the wider accord and a historic trip by President Clinton during his final weeks in office. “We were in the midst of serious negotiations on a moratorium on missiles and we ran out of time,” Sherman told me. “We did not get to it as President Clinton was also trying to do Middle East peace, and he didn’t have the time to do both.”", "The Framework deteriorated in the early years of the Bush Administration, which charted a tougher course. President Bush labelled North Korea one of three countries in an “axis of evil”—along with Iran and Iraq—in his 2002 State of the Union address. U.S. intelligence also disclosed that North Korea was secretly working on uranium enrichment. Washington stopped providing heavy fuel oil. Pyongyang expelled U.N. weapons inspectors. The Framework collapsed. In 2003, North Korea withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.", "The Bush Administration signed on to a new international effort in the ", ", which also included China, Russia, Japan and both North and South Korea. It was a diplomatic rollercoaster. In 2005, North Korea did agree—again—to ", " In exchange, it would—again—receive energy aid, security guarantees, and eventual normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. The process got bumpy after the U.S. Treasury ", " North Korean trading companies, as well as Banco Delta Asia, which it accused of laundering money on behalf of the North Korean government.", "“To North Korea, it seemed contradictory. It didn’t seem like the U.S. was acting in good faith,” Frank Aum, a former senior adviser on North Korea in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, who is now at the U.S. Institute of Peace, told me. “One day there was an agreement, the next day sanctions.”", "In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test as well as multiple missile tests. The Six Party Talks reconvened in 2007, offering a specific timeline of action and aid. In 2008, President Bush removed North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. But the initiative began to unravel again when the United States pushed to move up the verification process, partly to show a foreign-policy success at a time when it was bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan. Suspicions and distrust deepened in both Washington and Pyongyang, and the talks stopped.", "The Obama Administration made only one modest stab at diplomacy. On February 29, 2012, the so-called ", " required North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs—to be verified by international inspectors—in exchange for food aid and a U.S. statement of non-hostility. But the deal collapsed after North Korea announced plans to launch a satellite to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of founding father Kim Il Sung’s birth. The U.S. and five other nations viewed it as a violation of U.N. resolutions, even though satellites were not included in the agreement.", "Who was most at fault? “Hawks blame North Korea. Proponents of engagement argue that the U.S. didn’t live up to its terms in the nineteen-nineties,”Aum told me. “Both sides are right.”", "Bruce Klingner, the former C.I.A. deputy division chief for Korea,", " blames the skimpiness of past deals. “All the agreements on North Korea were short, vaguely worded documents that allowed everyone to have a different interpretation in order to reach an agreement,” he said. “If we get far enough down the road on this charm offensive, when it gets down to putting pen to paper, we need to have a far more detailed and clearly delineated agreement than any in the past.”", "But few with experience are optimistic about the prospects of what would almost certainly be diplomacy stretching over many years. The 2015 Iran deal took two years of intense diplomacy, had the backing of the world’s six major powers, and involved hundreds of personnel just from the United States.", "“People tend to look through ideological lens, touting one party over the other,” Klingner, who is now a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said. “I argue that neither party nor any Administration has any monopoly on good or bad ideas on North Korea. It’s Al Capone acts like Al Capone because that’s his nature—and it’s not dependent on the whether the mayor is a Democrat or Republican. The common denominator is that North Korea has cheated or not abided by any agreement it’s signed.”", "Given the history of diplomacy and North Korea’s current capabilities, there may be nothing that convinces the regime to give up its bombs or missiles. “We may get back to negotiations,” Aum told me. “The issue is how do we overcome the fundamental problem of whether North Korea really is willing to denuclearize, and, if so, at what cost? And is the U.S. willing to meet all its terms? The answer seems to be no. If we gave North Korea everything it wanted, it still wouldn’t denuclearize, because nothing guarantees your security more than a nuclear weapon.”"]},

Williams, entering her late thirties, plans to become the fourth."], "newsContext": ["Remember ", "the 2009 women’s semifinal at the U.S. Open, when Serena Williams played Kim Clijsters? Williams lost the first set, and then, trailing 5–6 in the second, and down 15–30, she was called for a foot fault on a second serve, making the score 15–40. She threatened to shove a tennis ball down “", "” of the line judge who made the questionable call, and was penalized a point for that, losing the game and thus, incredibly, the match as well. It was the story of that rain-drenched Open.", "But there was a remarkable story on the other side of the net, too. Clijsters had only recently rejoined the women’s tour after two years away. She’d played an exhibition, and then decided, with a what-the-heck shrug, to get back to competing for real. She’d gained entry into the Open only by way of a wild card. She had retired from the game to have and care for a baby. She would go on to win the title at that Open, defeating Caroline Wozniacki. Her cherubic daughter, Jada, toddled onto the court to be held by her mom, who was also managing to hold a large trophy. “We had planned Jada’s nap time for later than usual so that she could be here tonight,” Clijsters said during her on-court interview.", "Watching it all, it seemed . . . impossible. Only two other women in the Open era had won majors after having children: the great Australian Aboriginal player Evonne Goolagong won Wimbledon, in 1980, seven years after another Australian, Margaret Court, won three majors as a new mom. That was it. It’s just too hard on the body, and too demanding of both time and focus, to raise an infant and to raise your game to a Grand Slam-winning level at the same time. For most people, at least. “Surreal” is how Clijsters described it later, at her post-match press conference, when asked to explain her victory. “It wasn’t in the plans.”", "I found myself thinking of Clijsters on Thursday night, as Williams played her first match back on the women’s tour in more than thirteen months. She’s a new mom herself now, of course, having given birth to a daughter, Alexis Olympia, in September. For her, though, winning majors is in the plans: she has made no secret of the fact that she has returned to do exactly that. She is one shy of Court’s record of twenty-four Grand Slam victories. Court won most of hers under less competitive circumstances, before the Open era began, in 1968, allowing professionals to compete in the majors, and you would have to search long and hard to find someone who’d say that Williams is not the greater of the two players, or the greatest women’s player ever, for that matter. But that is not enough for Williams. It’s not at all clear that twenty-four majors would be enough.", "Nor is it clear, at this point, if and when she will be playing at a level necessary to win a major again, or even a big tournament like the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, where, on Thursday, unseeded after her maternity leave, she played her much-anticipated return match. The main Court 1 Stadium at Indian Wells was packed, as it rarely is for a first-round match. Fans were excited to have Serena back. That is not the same as an exciting match, or even a well-played one. Williams was rusty, of course, her lateral movement sluggish, and now and then she mis-measured her small adjustment steps, leaving her lunging for the ball. If she’d faced a tougher opponent—someone like, for instance, Japan’s emerging young star Naomi Osaka, who defeated Maria Sharapova in their first-round match Wednesday night—Williams might not have made it to round two. But she is moving on, after a 7–5, 6–3 win, thanks in no small part to her opponent, Zarina Diyas, a twenty-four-year-old Kazakh who is currently ranked No. 53 in the world. Diyas has no go-to shot, hits with neither depth nor pace, does not construct points, and has a second serve that would be a liability if she played for a small liberal-arts college. In the middle of the first set, as the players sat before changing ends, her coach, Roberto Antonini, came on the court and pleaded with Diyas to “play side to side” and “keep moving” Williams around—he could see that Williams was breathing heavily, perhaps tiring. Diyas did hit a few failed drop shots in the second set, but mostly continued to hit everything down the middle, hoping to extend rallies in which Williams would eventually make an unforced error. And Williams did make unforced errors: I counted twenty-seven of them over the course of the match. But Diyas made lots of errors, too, especially on big points, and she tallied nowhere near as many winners as Williams, who had more than thirty.", "Williams, dressed for the evening in matador black, did have stretches where she served hard and accurately. She has long possessed one of the purest service motions in tennis, and she has not lost it. She also set up inside the baseline on more than a few of Diyas’s patty-caked second serves to the deuce court and crushed forehand return winners crosscourt: vintage Serena. But she did none of this under sustained pressure. Nor was her endurance tested. It is simply too early", " to know when, or if, she will again be in a position to capture a major.", "It is worth mentioning that Clijsters was in her mid-twenties when she won the U.S. Open as a new mom. Goolagong and Court, too, were in their twenties when they came back from their maternity leaves to win majors. Williams is thirty-six, and not yet fully recovered from the pulmonary embolism that left her bedridden for weeks after giving birth. She has, she’s said, lost core strength, which is crucial for tennis. Can she find the time and summon the will to rebuild it? And how much rebuilding can be done by a player entering her late thirties? For Williams, winning another Grand Slam is not out of the question. It happening would just have you shaking your head. Impossible.", "If not Serena, then maybe Victoria Azarenka. She’s twenty-eight and has won two majors. In December, 2016, she had a baby boy, Leo, with her boyfriend, Billy McKeague, a resort golf pro. The couple split up last summer, and have been embroiled in a custody fight ever since. As a result, Azarenka was not permitted to travel with the child, forcing her to withdraw from last year’s U.S. Open and forego tour tennis last fall. It was reported that she won custody of the boy in January. Hours after Williams won her first match back, Azarenka, on the very same court, won hers, against Britain’s Heather Watson, in straight sets. Williams and Azarenka are rivals of a sort, but friendly ones. They talk together now of feeding schedules, bedtimes, and ", ". It’s a long shot, if not quite surreal, but they could meet, for the twenty-second time, in the semifinals."]},

So she stopped in a store, bought an Arsenal jersey, and brought\nit back, across the Atlantic, for her son.", "Arsenal has traditionally been one of the top clubs in England and,\nhistorically, among the top teams in the world. In 2003-2004, the club\nwent undefeated throughout the entire English Premier League season.\nOnly one team had done this before—Preston North End, in 1889—and many\nhad considered it to be impossible in modern English football, in which\neach Premier League team plays thirty-eight matches in the course of a nine-month season.\nDuring Arsenal’s undefeated season, I was a sophomore in high school, and I was beginning to convince\nmyself that I might be able to extend my own playing career beyond\ngraduation. I modelled my game after that of the Arsenal striker Thierry\nHenry—the swift, elegant Parisian with roots in the French Antilles, who\ncould transform a game in a matter of seconds.", "Watching Henry sprint and pirouette through defenders was breathtaking.\nBut it wasn’t just him—the entire Arsenal team was spilling over with\ntalent. Consider a sequence from a mild April night, in a match against\nLeeds United, in which Arsenal’s left back, Ashley Cole, headed the ball\nforward over the halfway line. The ball took a single bounce before the\nmercurial Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp, with his back to goal,\ncarefully nodded the ball toward Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva.\nSilva, a hard-nosed, defense-oriented player, used the inside of his\nfoot to direct the ball to the French forward Sylvain Wiltord, who, in a\nsingle motion, spun his body around while also playing the ball back to\nBergkamp. Bergkamp then threaded a perfect pass, through two defenders,\nonto the path of the long-haired Frenchman Robert Pirès, who curled the\nball past the Leeds goalkeeper, from about twenty yards away. It was an\nastonishing display of technique, emblematic of the precise,\nteam-oriented style that led the club to an entire season without a\nloss.", "That season was also the last time Arsenal won the Premier\nLeague. Since then, the club has experienced an unsettling decline, and\nthe team that now takes the field at the Emirates Stadium, in North\nLondon, is a fading shadow of what it was a decade ago. After\nnot qualifying for the Champions League—Europe’s preëminent\ninternational competition—for the first time in nineteen years, Arsenal\ncurrently sit at sixth place in the Premier League standings (the top\nfour teams qualify for the European competition). Increasingly, it looks\nlike they could miss out on qualifying again, and not only for the\nChampions League but also for the second-tier competition, known as the\nEuropa League.", "My relationship with Arsenal has been a long-distance love affair,\nstrained by the limitations of a seven-hour time difference, and I\ncannot always track the contours of its spiral from joy into\ndisillusionment. But at the center of both the club’s finest moments and\nits recent struggles is its longtime manager, Arsène Wenger. Wenger, a\nFrenchman with off-gray hair, a deeply furrowed brow, and a professorial\ndemeanor, has been the team’s manager since 1996, a run of nearly twenty-two years.\nIn Premier League history, his tenure is second in length only to Sir Alex\nFerguson, who led Manchester United for twenty-six years. The difference\nis that Ferguson won an astonishing thirty-eight trophies while leading\nthe Red Devils, including an unprecedented thirteen Premier League\ntitles. He averaged a championship title every other year. And, although\nWenger won three league titles and four FA Cups during his first decade\nas manager, his early success has been largely overshadowed by Arsenal\nnot winning a Premier League title in thirteen years. It is difficult to\nimagine another manager keeping his job for this long, especially\nwithout a title; recent\n", " shows that, on average, most last with a Premier League club for only a\nlittle more than a year and a half.", "Meanwhile, the decline continues. Arsenal’s best player over the past\nseveral years, the Chilean forward Alexis Sánchez, was recently\ntransferred to the rival team Manchester United, at his own request. It", " was a\ndevastating loss, but one slightly mitigated by the signing, that same\nweek, of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, the captain of the Armenian national team,\nand Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Gabonese international, who was the\nleading scorer in Germany’s top league last season. The results since\ntheir arrival have been inconsistent at best. Each has shown flashes of\nthe brilliance that made their signings so invigorating, but, at other\ntimes, they’ve completely disappeared from games. The team’s won only\nfour of its last nine matches, a record more reflective of a mid-table club,\nhappy just to be in the league, than one that has historically had\ntitle-chasing aspirations.", "But to be an Arsenal fan is to convince yourself that you can no longer\nsupport a team that disappoints you, only to be drawn back in by the\never-flickering promise of something better. Just last week, Arsenal\nlost to Brighton & Hove Albion, a team that wasn’t even in the Premier\nLeague last year, only to defeat A.C. Milan, one of the top clubs in\nEurope, at their historic home stadium, four days later, in Europa\nLeague play (Arsenal qualified for the tournament based on its Premier\nLeague performance last year). On Sunday, the team defeated Watford, securing a back-to-back Premier League victory for only the second time in the past sixteen games. But it was an underwhelming victory, and one that will do little to impress supporters who are unwilling to\nbe lured by glimmers of hope. This was most evident in the ", " during the game.", "Even if Arsenal defeat A.C. Milan again, in the second leg of their\nmatchup, in London, this week, and even if Arsenal makes it to and wins the\nEuropa League final, it will provide only temporary relief for a\nsystemic problem. For years now, Wenger has been unable to pull the\nbest from his players. Too often, they look uninspired. Even when they\nplay well, it’s often as islands of individuals rather than as a\ncohesive unit. Wenger is and will be remembered as one of the best\nmanagers in Premier League history, but with every passing week his\nlegacy becomes clouded by his inability to see that the club he helped\nbuild would be better served by another’s stewardship. I love Arsenal,\nand I love what Wenger has done for the team for more than two decades.\nBut every great coach must also know when it’s time to step aside. For\nWenger, that time is now."]},

When it first emerged in public, the\nhotel-room allegation’s credibility was so hotly debated, it split\nthe legendary investigative-reporting team of Bob Woodward and Carl\nBernstein, who won a joint Pulitzer Prize for their exposure of the\nWatergate scandal. Bernstein, who helped CNN break the news of the\nSteele dossier, last January, argued that it was “not fake news.” But\nWoodward dismissed it as “garbage,” a comment that won him a thank-you\nnote from Trump.", "In a new book being published on Tuesday, “", ",”\nthe co-authors Michael Isikoff and David Corn report an anecdote suggesting\nthat so-called golden showers were a form of entertainment familiar to\nsome in Trump’s circle, even if not necessarily to Trump himself.\nAccording to the authors, both of whom are veteran, Washington-based\ninvestigative reporters, in the early-morning hours of June 15, 2013,\nsome five months before the alleged Moscow incident, Trump visited a Las\nVegas night club called the Act that was infamous for its\nsexually explicit theatre shows. Among the skits regularly performed at\nthe Act were two in which semi-nude women would simulate urination\nonstage. As Isikoff and Corn note, it is unclear whether these skits\nwere performed on the night that Trump visited the club. But court\nrecords confirm that they were in the club’s regular repertoire.", "The reason that court records exist at all is that the Act’s obscene\nentertainment was, at the time of Trump’s visit, the target of a joint\nundercover investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the\nclub’s landlord, the Palazzo hotel and casino—which is owned by Sheldon\nAdelson, a major Republican Party donor. A few months after Trump\nvisited the Act, a Nevada state judge issued an injunction against the\nclub, shutting down its “lewd” and “offensive” performances. In the\ncourse of the legal wrangling, investigators submitted detailed\ndescriptions of the the Act’s shows. These, according to court records,\nincluded “simulated masturbation, simulated use of narcotics, use of\ndildos, strap-on penises, simulated defecation, and simulated\nurination.” In one skit, titled “Hot for Teacher,” an actor in the role\nof a professor would write an obscene title for a lecture on a\nblackboard, after which female actors purporting to be college girls\nwould disrobe and stand over the professor, appearing to urinate on him,\nbefore revealing a water bottle. In another skit, according to the court\nrecords, two women would drink from champagne flutes and snort a white\npowdery substance, after which they would undress, and one would\nsimulate urinating on the other, who would catch the liquid in two wine\nglasses and then drink it.", "Isikoff and Corn note that the Act closed after the judge ruled against\nit, and that they were unable to determine which skits were performed\nthe night that Trump attended, or even whether Trump paid any attention\nto what was onstage. Instead, Isikoff and Corn write that Trump’s focus\nthat night was apparently the cementing of a business relationship with\none of his companions, Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani pop singer. Trump,\nthe authors write, was wooing Agalarov’s wealthy and Kremlin-connected\nfamily in pursuit of potential Russian business deals. “Russian\nRoulette” quotes Rob Goldstone, a British publicist for the pop singer,\nwho was also present at the Act that night, recalling Trump extolling\nhis plans. Trump reportedly told Emin, “We’re going to have a great\nrelationship.” Later that day, Trump announced that the Agalarov family\nwould partner with him in ", " in\nMoscow. It was during the Miss Universe competition, in November of\n2013, according to the Steele dossier’s sources, that Trump allegedly\nengaged the prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton. (The White House did not\nrespond to a request for comment about the book’s allegations concerning\nTrump’s 2013 visit to the Las Vegas night club.)", "A source close to Steele, who declined to be identified, described the\noverlap between the Act’s performances and the Ritz-Carlton allegation\nas “interesting.” He acknowledged that for Steele, whose life and work I\n", " for ", ", the details in the new book are likely to be\n“something of a two-edged sword.” As he put it, “There’s a risk that\nthere was some conflation of the story,” meaning a blurring of what\nhappened at the Act and what allegedly happened at the Moscow hotel. But\nat the same time, he noted, “It does suggest that there is some kind of\ntrack record here. This behavior was not unheard of in Trump’s circle.\nSo in that sense, it adds to the credibility of the dossier.” (In\n“Russian Roulette,” Corn and Isikoff report that Steele would tell\ncolleagues his confidence in", " the Ritz-Carlton story was “fifty-fifty.”\nHe treated everything in the dossier as raw intelligence material—not\nproven fact.)", "“Russian Roulette” also sheds more light on Steele’s sources—whose\nidentities he has fiercely guarded. According to Isikoff and Corn,\nSteele’s sources include two figures whose expertise may be\nquestionable. One source for the “golden showers” allegation, according\nto Isikoff and Corn, was Sergei Millian, a mysterious\nBelarusian-American businessman whose claims to have been an intimate of\nTrump and his circle have been disputed by those close to Trump. The\nauthors assert that Millian was an “unwitting” source for Steele—that he\nspoke about Trump to an interlocutor without realizing that his\nstatements were being conveyed to the former British spy. Millian,\nhowever, has subsequently appeared on Russian television to deny that he\nhas ever had any damning information about the President. The Steele\ndossier, the authors write, “described Millian as a Trump intimate, but\nthere was no public evidence he was close to the mogul.” (The Steele\ndossier, however, did cite several other sources for the Ritz-Carlton\nallegation, whom Corn and Isikoff don’t mention, including a “member of\nthe staff at the hotel” and “a female staffer at the hotel when Trump\nstayed there.”) The other unconventional source, according to the\nauthors, is an unnamed woman whom they describe as “the paramour of a\nKremlin insider.” In other words, as they put it, some of the incendiary\nallegations against the President of the United States contained in the\nSteele dossier may have begun literally as “pillow talk.”"]},

The outgoing Secretary of State, Rex\nTillerson, who learned that he had been fired only after Trump announced\nhis departure in a tweet, clashed frequently with the President and\nlasted only fourteen months, although reports of his demise have been\ncirculating for the past five. “Pompeo is not Tillerson—but he could be\nsomeday, if the President keeps undercutting his Secretary of State,”\nthe former Ambassador Richard Boucher, a career diplomat who was the\nspokesman for three Secretaries of State, both Republican and\nDemocratic, said.", "The President and Pompeo, who is currently the director of the\nC.I.A. and must go through confirmation hearings before taking his new\npost, have clearly become chummy. Speaking from the White House South\nPortico, just minutes after Tillerson’s abrupt firing, Trump praised\nPompeo volubly. “I respect his intellect,” he said. “I respect the\nprocess that we’ve all gone through together. We have a very good\nrelationship, for whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is—why do\npeople get along? I’ve always, right from the beginning, from day one,\nI’ve gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.”", "The relationship developed in the course of intelligence briefings that\nPompeo delivered to the White House, which often gave him more access to\nthe President than Tillerson had as Secretary of State. Pompeo—a former\nTea Party congressman from Kansas, who attended Harvard Law School and\nWest Point—has been such a fixture at the White House that some\nintelligence professionals at the C.I.A. have privately complained that\nthey saw too little of him, compared with previous directors. Trump\nand Pompeo are also in synch in their hawkish views of America’s role in\nthe world. Pompeo was a cavalry officer in the Army between 1986 and\n1991.", "“I don’t know if it’s a victory by the über-hawks, but it reflects a\nmind-set about how Trump sees the world. He relies on generals,” Boucher\ntold me. “He’s looking for people who see every problem as a threat that\nneeds to be dealt with by military force, rather than an issue that can\nbe countered through diplomacy. There’s an over-all failure by this\nAdministration to understand what diplomacy can do for the country—and\nthe world.”", "In public statements, Pompeo has taken positions identical to—and in\nsome instances tougher than—the President’s on four pivotal issues:\nIran, North Korea, Russia, and Jerusalem. On each, Tillerson tried to\ntalk Trump down from irrational, impulsive, or controversial moves.", "Differences over the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran may have been at the\ntop of the list of disputes Trump had with Tillerson. “We disagreed on\nthings,” Trump said. “When you look at the Iran deal, I think it’s\nterrible. I guess he thought it was O.K. I wanted to either break it or\ndo something, and he felt a little bit differently. So we were not\nreally thinking the same.” He added, “With Mike Pompeo, we have a very\nsimilar thought process. I think it’s going to go very well.”", "While in Congress, Pompeo repeatedly condemned the nuclear deal\nbrokered by the Obama Administration and five other world powers as “an\nunconscionable arrangement that increases the risk to Kansans and all\nAmericans. The Iranian regime is intent on the destruction of our\ncountry. Why the President does not understand is unfathomable.”", "On the first anniversary of the nuclear deal, in 2016, Pompeo went\nfurther and called for the end of theocratic rule in Tehran. “Congress\nmust act to change Iranian behavior, and, ultimately, the Iranian\nregime,” Pompeo said. After Trump’s election, in 2016, Pompeo tweeted\nthat he looked forward to “rolling back this disastrous deal.” At the\nC.I.A., Pompeo also called for the release of classified material seized\nfrom Osama bin Laden’s compound that included material about\ncommunication between Iran and the Al Qaeda leader. So far, the Trump\nAdministration has denied in several briefings (in which I’ve\nparticipated) that it wants regime change, insisting that it seeks only a\nchange in Iran’s behavior.", "On North Korea, Pompeo made headlines last summer, when he implied, in a\nspeech at the Aspen Security Forum, support for regime change in North\nKorea. “The thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who\nholds control” of the country’s nuclear weapons, he said. “From the\nAdministration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is\nseparate those two.” After months of trading verbal threats of\nannihilation, President Trump accepted an invitation last week to meet\nwith Kim Jong Un. On Sunday, Pompeo said on Fox News that the United\nStates would offer not a single concession in negotiations with\nPyongyang. “Make no mistake about it,” he said.", "On Russia’s meddling in American elections, which has been confirmed by\nseveral U.S. intelligence agencies, Pompeo has echoed the comments of\nthe President. “It’s true, yeah, of course,” he\n", ", of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and in the election\n“before that, and the one before that.

At the\nC.I.A., he was technically", " restricted from making policy\nrecommendations, but he often came close in public events and\ninterviews. Trump often sought his opinions in private.", "But Pompeo’s style, like Trump’s, is based on confrontation rather than\ndialogue. In Congress, he was fiercely partisan and was not seen as a\nfigure who could reach across the political aisle. He was a pit bull\nabout the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s purported\nculpability in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three\nother Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\n“Instead of acting, Secretary Clinton and the rest of the administration\nwere already spinning while mortar rounds were falling and Americans\nwere dying,” Pompeo, a member of the Congressional committee that\ninvestigated the attack, said in a statement. The Stevens family publicly said that they did not blame\nClinton.", "Pompeo comes to the job with greater experience than Tillerson, a former\noil executive, had, however. For most of his professional life, he has\nbeen involved in various aspects of national security. He is also\ncredited with listening to career professionals at the C.I.A., something\nTillerson did not do at the State Department.", "“There is no way in the world that this is not an improvement over the\npresent situation at the State Department,” Robert Kagan, an\nanalyst, author, and former member of the State Department’s\npolicy-planning staff, told me. “Tillerson was an unmitigated disaster\nbecause of the way he and his people dealt with the foreign service and\nthe department in general. Pompeo will do a better job in working with\nthe department rather than trying to destroy it.”", "The problem, Kagan said, is less with personalities than with a lack of\npolicy. “There is no policy. There are impulsive reactions, which are\neither contained or not contained by his military entourage. That’s\nbasically all there is.”", "The Pompeo appointment faces criticism, however, because it appears to\nconsolidate the hold hawks have on the White House. “Trump is\nmethodically destroying the moderate camp in his Administration and\nmoving steadily crazy-hard right,” Joseph Cirincione, the president of\nPloughshares Fund, an N.G.O. dedicated to containing the spread of\nnuclear weapons, told me. “Today’s firing and the crude, insulting way\nthat he did it weakens the traditional conservative camp, the State\nDepartment, and American credibility. It’s almost as if someone is\npaying Trump to do it.”", "In an e-mailed statement, Thomas Countryman, a senior diplomat who\nresigned last year, said, “Tillerson has been a poor advocate for the\nState Department but he served as a Cabinet-level check on some of\nPresident Trump’s worst impulses.” Countryman, who served as the\nAssistant Secretary of State for International Security and\nNonproliferation, added, “If the new Secretary of State has a disdain\nfor diplomacy mirroring Trump’s, it will be bad for the department and\nthe country.”", "In Washington, a diplomat from a Western country told me that the\ndramatic firing and hiring on Tuesday reflected the “total dysfunction”\nin the Administration—as viewed by the outside world—and his belief that\nthings won’t get any better in the future. He compared the Trump\nentourage to a royal court in the seventeenth century or a Middle\nEastern kingdom today. Jared Kushner, he noted, had said privately, four\nmonths ago, that he wanted to “get rid” of Tillerson. “It has the\nstrange atmospherics of a royal court,” the diplomat said. “It’s half\ncomedy, half tragedy.”", "How long Pompeo will last is already the subject of political\nscuttlebutt in Washington. “Trump’s going to end up firing all these\nguys,” Kagan said, referring to the frequent departures from the\nAdministration. Tillerson’s dismissal has also deepened speculation\nabout the departure of the national-security adviser, General H. R.\nMcMaster. The former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, an über-hawk on\nforeign policy, visited the White House last week; Republicans in\nprevious Administrations told me that he is an increasingly likely\ncandidate to replace McMaster, whose long-winded lectures Trump has\ngrumbled about.", "The President initially surrounded himself with establishment figures—at\nthe State Department, the Pentagon, and the National Security\nCouncil—who often tried to talk Trump back from his most dramatic\ndecisions, a senior official from the Bush Administration told me.\nTillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis urged Trump against the\ndecision to formally recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move\nthe U.S. Embassy there, for example. “The President went with his gut,\nand he was right,” the former official said. “And then there wasn’t\nrioting from Casablanca to Baghdad, so the President may have decided he\nwas right—and wasn’t getting good advice.”", "“The President,” he added, “may have decided, ‘I’m good at this.’ And\nthat would suggest a more hawkish policy in the future.”"]},

According to a relative who asked not to be named, Salman\nunderstood that her husband had been thoroughly investigated and\nabsolved. “He was able to fool the F.B.I. with all their technology and\nsurveillance, but he’s not able to fool his wife?

On Monday, about an hour before\nthe President delivered a speech in Manchester revealing his\nAdministration’s policy responses to the opioid issue, I spoke on the\nphone with John Lyons, a prominent Republican attorney in Portsmouth and the\nformer state chair of both John McCain’s and Jeb Bush’s Presidential\ncampaigns. Lyons mentioned that though he himself had been “very\nfortunate” that no one in his immediate family had become addicted, many\nof his close friends had not been so fortunate. Just about everyone in\nNew Hampshire, he said, viewed the opioid crisis as universal. “It has\naffected professional people of means as well as people who put on their\nbluejeans and go to work,” he said. In New Hampshire, a very small,\nvery white state that has been flooded with tens of millions of\nprescription pain pills, the problem has prompted introspection. “It’s not being looked at as if it’s an\nincrease in crime, or ", " who don’t take care of their\nkids,” Lyons said. “It’s very much seen as the public-health problem it\nis.”", "Donald Trump’s Presidency has been so partisan and circumscribed—so\nconcentrated in Washington, and on the defense of orthodox Republican\nideas and the settling of petty feuds—that it is unusual to see Trump\nin the more mundane position required by the opioid epidemic, picking\nhis way through a problem on which neither party has a clear view and\nabout which we are still gathering evidence. Some of that uncertainty\ncrept into his address in Manchester, in which he promised, somewhat\nunexpectedly, that the Department of Justice would seek to bring cases\nagainst the pharmaceutical companies that had pushed opioids, and that\nhis Administration would increase funding for treatment for individuals\nbeing released from prison. He praised efforts to get overdose-treatment\ndrugs like Narcan into the hands of first responders and onto the\ncampuses of colleges and universities. “I’ve seen people that are just\nabout dead wake up,” the President said. These programs were largely\ncribbed from the Obama Administration, but Trump seemed invested in\nthem, and in the projection of empathy. He beckoned a couple, Jim and\nJeanne Moser, up to the podium to talk about their son, who had died from\nan overdose. “Beautiful son,” Trump insisted, not ungently.", "Even so, the President’s focus strayed. “Toughness is what they most\nfear,” Trump said, when he got to the part of his speech about drug\ndealers. Among his policy proposals, he wanted the death penalty\nextended to apply to drug dealers, and he made his case even though\nopioid country had not reacted warmly to the idea. (“Totally\nirrational,” a police chief who leads an opioid task force in southern Ohio ", ".) But Trump needs familiar villains. He blamed the city of Lawrence,\nMassachusetts, whose population is nearly three-quarters Hispanic, for\nsupplying Fentanyl to New Hampshire, and then segued into a discussion\nof the street gang MS-13 (“They don’t use guns—they would rather use\nknives because it takes longer and is more painful”), though it had no\nobvious connection to the opioid epidemic. He insisted that nations that\npunish drug traffickers with the death penalty (“I won’t mention the\nnames—you know the countries”) had no drug problem at all. The specific\ncrisis of opioids in New Hampshire, of the Mosers, was being abstracted\ninto one that had little to do with health and instead had a great deal\nto do with toughness.", "Often, with Trump, there is a wincing feeling that he is quoting from\nold episodes of our collective history. The cocaine crisis of the\nnineteen-eighties did not really hinge on wily outsiders—it was about a\nhealth crisis, too—but those were the most vivid stories, and so they got\ntold and retold. There were tales of the Chambers brothers, who imported\nteen-agers from the Arkansas delta to staff the crack houses of Detroit;\nthe Jamaican posses of North Miami and the Dominican dealers of\nWashington Heights; the smugglers who raced product in cigarette boats\nfrom the cays of the Bahamas and those who dug holes under the border\nwall. It did not seem coincidental that Melania Trump opened the event\nin Manchester by talking about the infants she’d seen in a Cincinnati\nhospital whose illnesses had been traced to their mothers’ addictions, or\nthat Trump kept insisting that he was personally in favor of “spending a\nlot of money on great commercials” that would persuade teen-agers not to\ntry drugs.

Trump’s approval ratings in the state are now around thirty\nper cent,", " and though Cullen allowed that most Republicans in the state\nwere still in Trump’s corner, he said that the President’s supporters whom he\nknew seemed less willing to defend him lately. “The first step of\nestrangement is holding your tongue,” Cullen said. While we spoke, the\nPresident was taking the stage in Manchester, before a handpicked\naudience of three hundred and fifty people at a community college. It\nseemed to Cullen that in trying to talk about New Hampshire’s experience\nwith addiction, Trump was talking past it. “The idea that what we need\nhere is capital punishment is not even on the list of how people talk\nabout this,” Cullen said. “It doesn’t connect at all.”"]},

The timing was no accident: the\nKremlin’s political strategists had hoped that holding the vote on the\nanniversary of the annexation, which is still popular in Russia, would\nboost voter turnout. (Putin’s victory was preordained; the Kremlin’s\nmain fear was that voters would be so uninterested in the election that\nthey would simply stay home.) It was also a fitting coda to Putin’s\n“Crimean” period, which began in 2012, when Russia unambiguously\ndeclared that it no longer wanted to accommodate Western values but to\nconfound and undermine them.", "Under Putin, Russian Presidential elections are not so much elections as\nthey are periodic opportunities for the President to reassert his power.\nVoters do not determine policy.

The other candidates were\ndecoys; the only credible challenger, Alexey Navalny, had been kept off\nthe ballot. (Ukraine, along with the United States and Europe, considers\nCrimea to be illegally annexed territory, and elections conducted there\na violation of international law.)", "On voting day in Sevastopol, I visited an unofficial campaign\nheadquarters for Putin in the center of town. It was staffed by\nAlexander Sinyavsky, an amateur kickboxer and the director of a\nchildren’s sports organization. He told me how he joined an unsanctioned\npro-Russia militia in the early, chaotic days before annexation. As we\nspoke, he played me various YouTube clips of him giving speeches in a\ncamouflage uniform and a red beret, filmed back in 2014. He told me of\nhis brother, who lives in Vladivostok, who had come to Sevastopol to\njoin him in the militia, and who had later gone to fight with\nRussia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Sinyavsky said that the\nPresidential election was a “form of thanks.” “We’re not so worried\nabout the results,” he told me; it was obvious that Putin faced no real\nchallengers. “From the very beginning we said our mission was boosting\nturnout.” The significance of the election, he said, was to “confirm the\nresults of the referendum” in 2014, a moment when “heart caught aflame.”", "Later in the day, I stopped by a polling place in a school up the hill\nfrom the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. The head of the precinct,\na sixty-nine-year-old woman who introduced herself as Ludmila\nKonstantinova, showed me a gold-colored medal that was being handed out\nto everyone who voted. The front side carried the date of the 2014\nreferendum; the back said, “With Russia forever!” Before I could even\nask, Konstantinova told me she would be happy for Putin to win: he’s\n“strong, full of will.” On my way out, she offered me a kind of warning,\nthough she delivered it with a chipper voice, and while kindly holding\nmy arm: “If we get treated poorly, if we’re upset or offended, we’ll\ngive out quite the beating.”", "Russian sociologists have called the boost in support for Putin and the\nstate in recent years the “Crimea effect.” Though its influence has\nstarted to fade across much of Russia, in Crimea itself it remains\npotent—at least for now.

He was in the crowd during Putin’s\nrecent visit, and noticed a change of mood: “Now people are calm. There\nare no tears, no ecstasy.” In 2014, he said, people in Sevastopol voted\nnot so much to join Russia but to return to the U.S.S.R., to restore the\nfeeling of belonging to a mighty and unified nation. “Instead, we simply\nbecame, well, today’s Russia, with all the pluses and minuses that\nentails.”", "For those in Sevastopol, the pluses include the fulfillment of belonging\nto a state with historical ambitions and a claim to great power.

But before\nthey could move in, a local court declared that the house should be\ndemolished because it was suspected of being used illegally as a\nmulti-unit dwelling. Protsenko insisted it was just a large space for\nhim and his ten relatives. The Protsenko family won the first case, but\nthen lost on appeal in a hearing that lasted all of five minutes.", "In months of negotiations with Sevastopol city officials and\nprosecutors, it was suggested to Protsenko that if he were just to give\nup a few rooms in his family’s new home—or, better yet, donate some\nacres of the surrounding property to the city—his legal problems would\ngo away. “I understand that it’s a business,” he told me. “If you give\nthem something, they leave you in peace. If you don’t, well, then, you\nasked for it.” Protsenko said they were thinking of appealing to\nRussia’s supreme court, and maybe the European Court of Human Rights,\nbut his family was tired. His wife recently suffered a heart attack and\nhas gone back to Nizhny Novgorod.", "After the annexation, Russia kicked off a renewed crackdown on free\nspeech, but in Crimea itself, the crackdown was even worse. The Crimean\nTatars, a Muslim minority who were largely against the Russian takeover,\nhave suffered the most, facing a wave of arrests and disappearances.\nEven in pro-Russia Sevastopol, authorities have had little patience for\nrebellion.", "On Election Day, I paid a visit to Ivan Markov, a left-wing activist who\nhad been arrested on suspicion of “extremism.” He was held in jail for\neight days while authorities investigated an illustration criticizing\nthe Russian Orthodox Church he posted on his social-media page back in\n2013. He told me he was targeted because of his efforts to organize\nunauthorized labor unions, and for his links to an anarchist who had\nbeen arrested. “To be honest, there aren’t many of us in all of Crimea,\nyou can count us on one hand,” Markov told me. He said he never had any\nillusions about Putin, and that he was opposed to both “Russian\nimperialism” and “Ukrainian nationalism.” Many people in Sevastopol, he\nadded, didn’t understand much about the country they were joining. “They\nthought the tough hand of Putin would come and restore order not just in\npolitics but in the economy, in social services, everything. But this\norder, if you can call it that, exists only in the creeping\npolice-ification of society.”", "In the evening, just after the polls closed, members of a number of\npro-Putin patriotic groups, along with some scattered locals, gathered\non the main square in Sevastopol, in front of the Soviet monument to\nvictims of the Second World War. A military band from the Black Sea\nFleet stirred up the crowd with brassy marching tunes. A few people made\nspeeches. The last to go was a self-styled local poet named Anna Tsysar,\nwho composes rather martial verses about military battles and other\nhistorical glories. (A local friend in Sevastopol said that Tsysar\nwrites the rare genre of poetry that “a guy starts to pound his fist on\nthe table to after a few swigs of vodka.”) Her voice was booming. “Our\nmotherland is united,” she began. “As soon as Russia rises from its\nknees / its foes squeeze into formidable ranks / hypocritically thinking\nof themselves as the messiah / bringing the chaos of revolution,\ndiscord, and trouble / but we are a great Slavic power.” It was\ncomically overwrought, but also telling: her poem got to the essence of\nwhat Putin had offered Russians in these past few years—an opportunity for an\naggrieved and wounded state to lash out at its enemies and make up for a\ngeneration’s worth of slights and insults.", "In a sense, that political gambit worked. Putin has gained another term\nhaving received the imprimatur of his Presidential referendum. During\nhis nonexistent campaign, Putin didn’t offer a new vision or articulate\nwhy he should continue to rule. The so-called Crimea argument, as it\nwere—combined with a completely denuded and thoroughly controlled\npolitical sphere—meant he didn’t really have to. The question for\nRussia, and for the rest of the world, is whether that will have to\nchange. Or if, at this stage in Putin’s rule, there’s really anything\nelse to offer."]},

They and others who took the quiz likely did not know that they were giving GSR permission to access their Facebook friends’ profiles. If Facebook officials were not aware of this at the time, when GSR sold this data to Cambridge Analytica, they certainly knew it by January, 2017, when the Swiss researchers Hannes Grassegger and Mikael Krogerus published “The Data That Turned the World Upside Down,” a detailed account of how C.A.’s psychological modelling was used by the Trump campaign.

During the 2016 campaign, according to Cadwalladr, C.A. was staffed primarily by non-U.S. citizens, in possible violation of American campaign-finance laws. This included the contractors the firm brought to Austin, Texas, to work with Trump’s digital team there.", "“We were really speaking directly to the voters in a number of states,” one former C.A. employee, who worked with a number of non-U.S. citizens or green-card holders, ", ". Cadwalladr writes, “It is understood that some were working on tourist visas. Another ex-employee claimed that", " they had been provided with letters to give to US border control officials where needed, stating that they would not be working” in the United States. And, she points out, Bannon, Nix, and Rebekah Mercer (Robert’s daughter) knew that this was illegal. Their counsel, who happened to work at Rudolph Giuliani’s law firm, let them know in a memo written in July, 2014.", "These Cambridge Analytica contractors worked with Trump’s digital team, headed by Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner. Alongside all of them were Facebook employees who were embedded with the Trump campaign to help them use Facebook’s various tools most effectively—including the so-called “dark posts,” used to dissuade African-Americans from showing up to vote. Did any of them know that the data that Cambridge Analytica was using to target voters, craft ads and blog posts, and determine Trump’s travel schedule came from millions of American Facebook members whose data had been taken without consent and sold for a million dollars—what Cadwalladr is calling a massive data “breach”? Maybe, or maybe not—and it hardly matters. For more than a year, Cadwalladr has done yeoman work, reporting on the nihilism of Bannon and the Mercers, the cravenness of Nix, and connecting the dots between them and Trump and Facebook. But those millions of Facebook profiles do not in fact constitute a breach: they were obtained legally. Nobody hacked Facebook—nor would they have had to—because the business model of Facebook is predicated on mining the personal details of its two billion users. In a ", " on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg could only chalk the whole saga up to “a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.” The company is aided in maintaining this position by privacy policies that are as obscure as they are lax. As a consequence, Facebook created the conditions for millions of Americans to become unwitting cogs in the effort to get Trump elected.", "Christopher Wylie knew all this, and he watched what he now calls his “grossly unethical experiment” unfold in real time. It is, he says, “something that I regret.” So now he’s blown the whistle and, in turn, Facebook has suspended his account. The company may have shot the messenger, but, even so, his message has been heard loud and clear, in Parliament (where Nix, who has now been suspended by Cambridge Analytica, will be called back to explain what appear to be the lies he told there last month, during hearings on fake news), in Congress (where Nix and possibly Zuckerberg will also be called to account), on the front page of newspapers around the world, and on Twitter (where the hashtags “Where’s Zuck?” and “DeleteFacebook” have been trending). Wylie’s words have also reverberated on Wall Street, where, in the first two hours of trading after his video confession (and the news that he had supplied e-mails and documents to American and British authorities), Facebook stock lost thirty billion dollars in value. It is now down by sixty billion dollars. It would not be wrong to call this payback."]},

The provision, as it is currently written, dictates that\nminor-league baseball players, during the league’s championship\nseason—i.e., not during spring training or the offseason—will be paid\n“at a rate that is not less than a weekly salary equal to the minimum\nwage” for a work week of forty hours, “irrespective of the number of\nhours the employee devotes to baseball related activities.” The federal\nminimum wage is $7.25, so what this guarantees is a monthly salary, for\nroughly six months out of the year, of about $1,160.

Under the most recent collective-bargaining agreement,\nminimum annual pay for a major leaguer is $507,500.)", "A spokesperson for Major League Baseball declined to comment for this\npiece. In the past, the league has argued that minor-league baseball is\nnot a career but an apprenticeship, and one that is heavily subsidized\nby the major-league clubs that oversee the minor-league teams.

It has\nnothing to do with government spending. It was done behind closed doors\nand we didn’t see the language until it came out last night. It’s\nappalling.”", "Spokespeople for Senators Mitch McConnell and Charles Schumer,\nCongresswoman Nancy Pelosi, and Congressman Kevin McCarthy did not\nrespond to a request for comment on the baseball provision.

He worries that if wages at the\ndifferent minor-league levels continue to stay where they are, it could\ndeter young stars from embarking on a baseball career. “It doesn’t make\nsense at all,” he said. “When you have a first baseman that makes less\nthan", " the bat boy, that’s a problem.”"]},

SamSam, a “shadowy\nhacking crew,” as the ", " described it, had reportedly penetrated\nthe city’s computer network with ", "—a\ndecade-old technology that infects a computer or a network and blocks\naccess to personal data through encryption—and was holding access to the\nnetwork for ransom: approximately fifty-one thousand dollars, to be paid\nin bitcoin. Atlanta was the latest in a series of ransomware victims:\nFedEx, Britain’s public-health system, ", ",\nand many other public and private-sector entities ", ". But Atlanta is the largest American city to have fallen victim to the\nploy.

(Bottoms has been busy with damage control, tweeting\nto her constituents about ", " of not being able to pay their parking tickets online, and ", ".\nThe city’s official ", " went online this morning.) A few sources, who asked to remain anonymous,\nhave told me that the ransom, though a relatively—even strangely—modest\nsum for a city with a budget in the billions, has likely not been\nremitted. Shook said that “the city does not appear to have a policy\nregarding the paying of ransoms.” One city official told me, “We’re so\nfucked. We’re not paying the ransom. There’s no point. We’ll bite the\nbullet and re-build our system in a stronger way.” Another frustrated\nemployee, who has worked for the city for more than a decade, said the\ncity never spends enough to sufficiently address these sorts of\nproblems. “They’re all about lowest bidder,” he said.", "In the meantime, Shook and others are perplexed by the seemingly random\nfocus of the attack. The District Eight council office, next door to\nShook’s, also has three computers; two of them are still functional.\n“It’s the same on down the hall,” he said. In any case, he doesn’t see\nmuch good in paying a ransom. “The damage is done,” he said. “Stuff is\nlost. I’m a tiny little example, but my computers—the contents have to\nbe euthanized.” He added, “We’ll rebuild the contacts, but, for me, the\nlesson learned is: this longtime goal of moving to a paperless society\nlooks a lot less exalted now than it did a week ago. I’d give anything\nfor a hard copy of everything I lost.”", "A federal criminal investigation is currently under way. So far, federal\nofficials have not revealed any details about how the attack occurred,\nwhich individuals carried it out, or why. (The SamSam crew was\nidentified by researchers at an Atlanta-based security firm that is\nassisting the city in its response.) Shook met with the federal\ncybersecurity team—“Secret Service, Homeland, F.B.I., everyone but Jack\nBauer,” he said—and has busied himself learning about hacking crimes\ngenerally. “This happens to individuals. This happens to private\ncompanies. To public entities. Welcome to the evils of the twenty-first\ncentury. I can’t wait to find out how this pathogen entered the city\nsystem.” A former city employee, who left her job last year, told me,\n“When I was there, I was appalled at how shaky the I.T. infrastructure\nwas. Every time there was a network outage the I.T. department sends a\nnotification. I got those notifications so frequently", " that I just\nstarted deleting them.”", "The city’s executive committee had a closed-door session yesterday to\ndiscuss the attack. The city’s administration told them that, moving\nforward, there would be more sophisticated strategies in place to thwart\nhackers. Computers would be rebuilt and workers retrained with\nanti-malware services. “What I don’t want to do is spend a whole bunch\nof money and then have this happen again,” Shook said. “But I don’t know\nwhat the model for a solution is, unless it’s military-grade,\nnuclear-submarine-type stuff.” He went on, “There’s a lot of really\nsmart criminals out there. We have ninety-seven hundred city employees.\nAll it takes is for one of them to open an attachment they shouldn’t\nopen. Well, that’s hard to defend.”"]},

That June,\nKuczynski—or P.P.K., as he is widely known—had unexpectedly defeated\nKeiko Fujimori in Peru’s Presidential election, winning by less than one\nper cent of the over-all vote. But Fujimori’s Fuerza Popular Party still\ndominated Congress. The Fujis, Kuczynski said, were clearly determined\nto make his life in office impossible; they had been blocking his\nCabinet choices and voting against everything he proposed. Unless he\ncould find a way to halt them, he would have a hard time getting\nanything done.", "Kuczynski’s worries turned out to be well placed. On Wednesday, one day\nahead of an all-but-certain impeachment vote in Congress, he appeared on\ntelevision to announce his resignation from the Presidency. Seated at a\ndesk and flanked by his Cabinet members, who stood uncomfortably behind\nhim, Kuczynski fulminated against those who had driven him from office.\nHe said that he had been falsely painted as corrupt, and that his\nopponents had brought about “a situation of ungovernability.” For the\ngood of Peru, he said, he was stepping down.", "Kuczynski’s Presidency had been hanging by a thread since the end of\nlast year, when he narrowly survived a first impeachment vote. His\nopponents—led by “the Fujis”—had moved against him following revelations\nthat, while he had been a minister in a previous government, his private\ninvestment company had received several million dollars in payments from\nthe Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. For the past several years,\nOdebrecht has been implicated in one of Latin America’s largest-ever\ncorruption scandals, centered in Brazil and known there as Operation Car\nWash. Odebrecht officials, who have been coöperating with prosecutors in\nexchange for lesser jail time, have revealed that, over a decade, the\ncompany spent eight hundred million dollars in bribes around Latin\nAmerica to secure official contracts worth billions. They have provided\nevidence showing that twenty-nine million dollars of the total went into\nofficials’ pockets in Peru. Both of P.P.K.’s immediate predecessors,\nAlejandro Toledo and Ollanta Humala, were fingered as recipients of some\nof the bribe money. Early last year, Humala was arrested and imprisoned,\nwhere he remains, awaiting trial, while Toledo, who has been convicted\nin absentia, has refused to come home from an aerie in California.", "Kuczynski had denied ever receiving any payments from Odebrecht. But\nlate last year it emerged that while he was serving as a minister in\nToledo’s government, a business partner had received money from the\ncompany. Kuczynski claimed not to know about the payments, which were\napparently legal ones—Odebrecht’s officials, who knew about such things,\nhave said that the fees paid to Kuczynski’s firm were aboveboard and\nnot part of their bribery scheme. Still, things did not look good.", "In an atmosphere of gathering public mistrust, Kuczynski’s moral\ncharacter was called into question. He defended himself, but clumsily,\nin a public television roundtable with journalists, and then, when the\nimpeachment vote came to a head, he survived thanks only to the\nabstentions of a few Fuerza Popular congressmen loyal to Keiko\nFujimori’s brother Kenji. This raised some eyebrows. Three days later,\nwhen Kuczynski issued a pardon to the ailing, imprisoned Fujimori\nsenior, it was clear to everyone that a deal had been done. Kuczynski\nwas excoriated by many of his former allies, and a number of his\nministers resigned in disgust.", "Kuczynski’s reprieve did not last long. This week, as he and his\nopponents squared off for another impeachment vote, several videos\nemerged, apparently shot last December. They show Kenji Fujimori, a\nlawyer for Kuczynski, and a senior government official offering to give\na congressman a cut from public-works contracts in return for his\nsupport for Kuczynski in the first impeachment vote. Kuczynski denied\nany knowledge of the shenanigans apparently undertaken on his behalf,\nbut the damage was done, and his resignation came within twenty-four\nhours.", "The great irony of Kuczynski’s downfall is that he ran for the\nPresidency on a promise to bring transparency to government. It was also\na dismal end to a long and distinguished public career, one that at its\nheight—immediately after he won the Presidency—had appeared to offer a\nfresh start to a country with a calamitous, even shameful, recent\npolitical history.", "One could choose different moments to begin the chronology, but most\nPeruvians would agree that the country’s fall from grace, and from\nself-faith, began with Fujimori’s ten-year Presidency, which ended\nignominiously in 2000, when he fled the country to Japan, in the midst\nof an erupting corruption scandal involving his right-hand man,\nVladimiro Montesinos, Peru’s spy chief. Fujimori informed his countrymen\nof his resignation by fax from Tokyo. After five years in Japan, the\nex-President travelled to Chile, where the government arrested him and\nextradited him back to Peru for trial. He was convicted and sentenced to\ntwenty-five years in prison for crimes against humanity and\ncorruption—until Kuczynski’s pardon last December. (Montesinos, meanwhile, was run to ground in 2001 in", " Venezuela. Since\nbeing brought back to Peru he has remained in prison, where he has been\nperiodically tried and convicted of crimes ranging from torture and\nbribery to drug and arms trafficking. In his latest trial, in 2016, he\nwas sentenced to twenty-five more years in jail. Now seventy-two, he\nseems unlikely ever to leave prison.)", "Peruvians are reeling from a lack of faith in their institutions and\ntheir national morale is at an all-time low. A tweet I saw from a Peruvian\non Friday seemed to say it all: “By the way, what do you think about\nPerú? It’s latin america, we have no hope.” Kuczynski has been\nsupplanted by his Vice-President, Martín Vizcarra, and the Fujimori\nsiblings have been duking it out in Peru’s congress, with Keiko\nexcoriating her brother for his involvement in a vote-buying scheme, and\nKenji blaming his sister for sending a loyalist spy to make the secret\nvideotapes and releasing them. It was all rather creepy, a disquieting\necho of the behavior that cost their father the Presidency eighteen\nyears ago. Kenji Fujimori quit the Fuerza Popular Party in March, and\npromised to form his own, with an eye, evidently, to run against his\nsister in 2021. Recalling that December, 2016, dinner with Kuczynski, I\nremember him saying that unless the Fujis could be stopped, he was\ndoomed, and he was right. Now the question is, what lies ahead for Peru?"]},

The Trump Administration will expel sixty Russian diplomatic\nstaff from the U.S., including from Russia’s mission to the United\nNations; it will also close the Russian consulate in Seattle.", "The fact that several dozen Russian diplomats will be sent packing is\nnot in and of itself a great loss for the Kremlin. Such expulsions,\nwhich were a regular feature of the Cold War, have taken on the air of\nritualized formality, and represent more symbol than substance. The loss\nof Russian personnel may inflict some short-term costs on Russian\nintelligence gathering, but it’s far from a top-to-bottom roundup.", "More important is that Washington and fourteen European Union countries\nannounced the measures as a single, unified policy decision. Over the\nlast several years, the Kremlin’s overarching goal has been to split\nalliances and weaken institutions in the West, hoping that Russia can\nfracture or otherwise prove feckless multilateral bodies such as the\nE.U. and ", ". As part of those aims, it would also like to weaken\ndiplomatic and security coöperation between the United States and\nEurope. That is why the Kremlin welcomed Brexit, and why it was, at\nleast initially, buoyed by the election of Donald Trump, a candidate who\nwas hostile to exactly the sort of alliances and multilateral bodies\nthat the Kremlin itself wanted to upend. Putin wants to deal with states\nindividually, old-school Realpolitik style, thinking—perhaps\ncorrectly—that he can play a stronger hand one-on-one, rather than\nfacing a united front.", "The symbolism, then, comes from the synchronization of the expulsions—it\nis that fact, more than the difficulty of losing this or that diplomat\nabroad, that will register in Moscow. It was not entirely obvious that\nthe United Kingdom would be able to successfully negotiate a coördinated\npolicy response with a body, the European Union, that it is in the\nprocess of leaving; nor that the Trump Administration, marked by its\ncapriciousness and penchant for isolationism, led by a President with a\ndemonstrated affinity for Putin, could be persuaded to join in. The fact\nthat U.S. and European officials were able to pull off this small feat\nof multilateral diplomacy suggests the notion of Western security\ncoöperation may yet have some steam left in it. In calling the\nexpulsions a “provocative gesture of solidarity,” the Russian Foreign\nMinistry was perhaps accidentally a bit too honest in revealing what\nMoscow finds most troubling in the move.", "But it is also telling that, although many E.U. governments moved to\nexpel Russian diplomats from their territory, almost half did\nnot—exactly the sort of intra-E.U. split that the Kremlin has been\nhoping for and trying to foster for years. Last week, Alexis Tsipras,\nthe Prime Minister of Greece—which is not expelling any diplomats—gave a\nsquishy position on the Skripal poisoning, offering his country’s\n“solidarity” with the United Kingdom, but remained noncommittal on\ncountermeasures, saying, “We need to investigate.” On Monday, the\ncenter-right Austrian government, led by a party with long-standing ties\nto Russia, also declined to join the expulsions. Chancellor Sebastian\nKurz has said that the nation wants to serve as a “bridge-builder\nbetween East and West.” These policy differences are a thread on which\nthe Kremlin will continue to pull, and now it knows exactly where the\nseams are.", "Monday’s expulsions are yet another data point in a growing, rather\nparadoxical reality, in which Trump as an individual continues to act\nglaringly conciliatory to Putin, yet his Administration repeatedly takes\nmeasures that are arguably more hostile to Putin than those enacted\nunder Obama. It was the Trump Administration, for example, that approved\nthe sale of anti-tank Javelin missile systems to Ukraine, earlier this\nmonth—a weapons transfer that is anathema to Putin, and one the Obama\nAdministration did not authorize. And in December, 2016, Obama, in\nresponse to Russia’s election meddling, expelled thirty-five Russian\ndiplomats, almost half the number named by Trump on Monday.", "Moscow has surely noticed that Trump can’t bring himself to say a bad\nword about Putin; but it is no less glaring that his Administration\nproves, over and over again, to be quite hawkish in its Russia policy.\nWhether out of hope-dies-last faith or because they know something we\ndon’t, Russian officials continue to try and separate Trump from just\nabout everyone else in Washington, holding on to the idea that Trump is\nbeing forced to lash out against Russia by others in government. On\nMonday, a Russian senator from the Foreign Affairs Committee said that\nTrump authorized the expulsions only “under the strongest pressure from\nthe American establishment.” At this point, what else can Russian\nofficials say? It’s not clear they have a policy Plan B for dealing with\nTrump other than to hope that, like U.S.-European relations or ", ", the\nPresident and the foreign-policy apparatus in Washington is an\ninstitutional relationship that can be split apart.", "Russia will surely enact reciprocal measures, expelling a comparable\nnumber of U.S. and European diplomats. It will likely close a U.S.\nconsulate somewhere in the country. (The Twitter account belonging to\nthe Russian Embassy in Washington\n", " followers to vote for which U.S. consulate should be closed: St.\nPetersburg, Vladivostok, or", " Yekaterinburg.) These impending losses to\nthe U.S. diplomatic corps will complicate the work of the Embassy in\nMoscow, which lost seven hundred and fifty-five foreign service officers\nand support staff in the last round of tit-for-tat\n", ", in July. More unpredictable and asymmetric responses are also\npossible; after the United Kingdom expelled twenty-three Russian\ndiplomats earlier this month, not only did the Kremlin respond in kind\nbut it ordered the closure of the British Council, a U.K.-run cultural\ninstitution that funded popular exhibits, performances, and festivals\nthroughout Russia.", "Ultimately, diplomatic expulsions are the easy and obvious policy\nsolution. They don’t force London and other European financial centers\nto confront uncomfortable truths about the amount of Russian money\nsloshing through their financial institutions and real-estate markets.\nThe United Kingdom, especially, is sensitive to the loss of\ninternational capital at a time when its status as a global financial\nhub is already in question because of Brexit.", "That leaves demonstrative measures like Monday’s expulsions—the Kremlin\nwon’t like them, but it can certainly live with them. It will easily be\nable to portray them as part of the West’s ingrained Russophobia. After\nPutin’s ", " last week, his campaign\nspokesman, Andrey Kondrashov, explicitly\n", " how Putin benefitted from tensions with the United Kingdom over Skripal.\n“We must say thanks to Great Britain,” Kondrashov said, explaining how\nthe Kremlin met its seventy-per-cent target for voter turnout. “We were\npressured exactly at the moment when we needed to mobilize,” he said,\nadding that, when Russia is accused of something on the world stage,\n“the Russian people unite around the center of power. And the center of\npower is certainly Putin.”", "But the Russian public has little sympathy for the oligarchs and corrupt\nofficials who park their money in the West, and going after them would\nmeet with sympathy—even outright support—inside Russia itself. Imagine\nthe difficulty for Russia’s television propagandists in spinning to\nviewers why they should be outraged that a bureaucrat lost access to his\napartment in London or villa in the South of France. Yet that would\ncarry a real, not just theatrical cost, for the governments carrying out\nsuch measures. In other words, a U.S. or E.U. crackdown on illicit cash\nand investments coming from Russia would be a truly significant sanction,\nnot just for those on the receiving end but for those enacting it—which\nis exactly the reason it’s not happening."]},

Group,\nthe parent company of Cambridge Analytica. This code provided a look at\nthe internal mechanics of what the company had been doing.", "The software uncovered by Vickery appears to have been first created in\n2014, when Cambridge Analytica was working on a number of midterm\nelection campaigns, and used at least until the period in the 2016 cycle\nwhen the company was working for Senator Ted Cruz during his\nPresidential primary campaign. According to Vickery’s ", ", the\nA.I.Q. repository includes “a set of sophisticated applications, data\nmanagement programs, advertising trackers, and information databases\nthat collectively could be used to target and influence individuals\nthrough a variety of methods, including automated phone calls, emails,\npolitical websites, volunteer canvassing, and Facebook ads.” Its core\ninstrument, which its authors called the “Database of Truth,” was\ndesigned to gather and integrate voter-registration data, consumer data,\npolling data, and data “from third-parties”—it is possible that the\nfifty million profiles of unwitting Facebook users that Cambridge\nAnalytica acquired would fall under this final, vague category. Vickery\nis currently combing thousands of pages of code to see how, or if, it\nmight have used people’s psychological touch points.", "While Vickery looks for proof of C.A.’s psychographic work, Kimberly\nFoxx, the state’s attorney of Cook County, Illinois, has filed a civil suit\nagainst both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook for deceptive business\npractices, claiming, among other things, that “armed with swaths of\nmisappropriated data, Cambridge Analytica created ‘psychographic\nprofiles’ on every American adult, which it claims helped it have\nsignificant influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.”\nThe suit takes for granted that C.A. engaged in psychographic targeting,\nand argues that psychographic methods bypass “individuals’ cognitive\ndefenses by appealing directly to their emotions, using increasingly\nsegmented and sub-grouped personality type designation and precisely\ntargeted messaging based on those designations.”", "The question remains whether this kind of targeting can actually\ninfluence people’s behavior. Last summer, at the DefCon hacking\nconference in Las Vegas, Sumner, who has been studying variants of this\nquestion for the last seven years through his work at the Online Privacy\nFoundation, presented the group’s latest research.", "Sumner and his research partner, Matthew Shearing, used survey questions—along with a process, similar to one developed at Cambridge University, that enables social scientists to find subjects based on Facebook’s understanding of their psychological makeup—to evaluate 2,412 people’s\npropensity for a single underlying psychological tendency, in this case\nauthoritarianism. They then created advertisements that either advocated\nor opposed state-sanctioned mass surveillance. An ad that read,\n“Terrorists—Don’t let them hide online. Say yes to mass surveillance,”\nwith a picture of a mangled, bombed-out buildings appealed to people\nwith higher authoritarian tendencies. An ad that said, “Do you really\nhave nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide? Say no to mass\nsurveillance,” alongside a photo of Anne Frank, appealed to those on the\nlow end of the authoritarian spectrum.", "Then Sumner and Shearing flipped the script. Respondents with an\nauthoritarian bent reacted positively to an ad with the words “They\nfought for your freedom—Don’t give it away. Say no to surveillance”\nsuperimposed over a photo of a D-Day landing. And those who would\notherwise be described as anti-authoritarian were swayed to support\nsurveillance by an ad that listed a host of bad things, including human\ntrafficking, cyber crime, terrorism, and money laundering, with the\nwords “Crime doesn’t", " stop where the Internet starts. Say yes to\nsurveillance.” By rewording the ads to appeal to the respondents’\nunderlying psychological disposition, the researchers were able to\ninfluence and change their opinions. According to Sumner, “Using\npsychographic targeting, we reached Facebook audiences with significantly\ndifferent views on surveillance and demonstrated how targeting . . . affected return on marketing investment.” Psychological messaging, they said, worked.", "Facebook has come to this conclusion, too. As Cook County’s\nlawsuit points out, Facebook has undertaken a number of research\nprojects—without the consent of its users—aimed at understanding how the\nplatform might be used to influence user behavior. Most famously, there\nwas its mood-control experiment, published in ", ", in 2014, in which the company manipulated\nits news feed so that seven hundred thousand of its users saw primarily\npositive or primarily negative content. The goal was to find out if\n“emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion,\nleading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness.”\nThe company found that they could. Even more germane, in 2010, Facebook\nsuccessfully showed that it could influence voter turnout. These were\nnot purely academic inquiries. The Cook County lawsuit also points out\nthat Facebook is more valuable to both its business and political\nclients if it can demonstrate that it can be used “to manipulate its\nusers into making decisions that they want them to make.”", "The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of the residents of Illinois, and if\nthe court accepts its demand for a jury trial, discovery promises the\npossibility of exposing truths belied by promotional material and\nobscured in software. It may seem quixotic to sue a slippery outfit like\nCambridge Analytica or a behemoth like Facebook.

(The name is a riff on Justice\nLouis Brandeis’s quotation that sunlight is “the best of\ndisinfectants.”) In recent months, after #MeToo, several states,\nincluding New York and California, have proposed new legislation\nprohibiting confidentiality provisions in contracts that have the\npurpose or effect of concealing discrimination or harassment. The ", " that Congress passed in December even included a provision disallowing a\ndeduction for “any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or\nsexual abuse if such settlement or payment is subject to a nondisclosure\nagreement.” The ", " contends that an agreement that has the effect of coercing a person not\nto speak out on matters of public concern violates “foundational tenets\nof our system of government, including freedom of expression and\nconscience and freedom of the press.”", "Amid these developments, it is tempting to think of the McDougal and\nClifford cases as part of a building national referendum on\nnondisclosure agreements and their enforceability. This momentum is\ngrowing in part because of ", ",\nfirst reported in the Washington ", ", that Trump’s senior White House\nstaffers have signed confidentiality agreements, which are likely\nunenforceable and unconstitutional. In his long business and personal\nlife, Trump has likely made thousands of contracts with associates,\nemployees, sexual partners, and “Apprentice” contestants containing\nconfidentiality provisions—if McDougal and Clifford’s deals were to\nslide, so could they all.

Sometimes the ", " bargaining chip the less powerful party has is the possibility of\nsilence. Victims seeking redress could be left worse off.", "It’s significant that McDougal and Clifford are both making very\nspecific arguments against the validity of their contracts—arguments\nthat don’t necessarily touch the enforceability of N.D.A.s, per se. Clifford claims the contract is void because Trump’s lawyer, Michael\nCohen—rather than Trump himself—signed it, and because of the draconian\namount that it obligates her to pay for breaching it. On “60 Minutes,”\nshe told Anderson Cooper that she was physically threatened by an\nunknown Trump surrogate in 2011; what she alleges amounts to extortion,\nwhich would imply that she may not have entered freely into her 2016\ncontract. McDougal, for her part, claims that she signed her “catch and\nkill” contract with A.M.I. thinking it obligated the company to publish\nmore than a hundred of her newspaper columns (which it did not).\nImportantly, both women allege that the money they received may have\ncircumvented federal campaign-finance law, because the payments were\nunreported expenditures by, or contributions to, Trump’s campaign,\nintended to influence the election.", "These claims open up the possibility that the legal system may find ways\nto avoid enforcing these agreements—or at least trim their\nexcesses—without seriously undermining the broader phenomenon of buying\nand selling confidentiality through contract. Nondisclosure of the\nactions of a future President may be too much to expect, under any\ncircumstances.

Kennedy scribbled a few words onto a legal pad, but mostly he just stared out the window. ", ", had been killed in Memphis earlier that evening. When Kennedy heard the news, aboard his campaign plane, his head snapped back as if he himself had been struck; then he buried his face in his hands. Later, as his car arrived at the rally, his staff scanned the periphery of the park for snipers.", "Looking shaken, Kennedy climbed onto a flatbed truck to address the crowd. Many had not heard the news about King; they had been waiting in the park for hours, holding “Kennedy” signs. He asked them to put the signs down. “I have some very sad news for all of you,” he said. “And I think some sad news for all of our fellow-citizens and people who love peace all over the world. And that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight, in Memphis, Tennessee.”", "The crowd convulsed. People fell to their knees and wept. But as Kennedy spoke they became quieter and moved closer to him. “For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people,” he ", ", “I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my own family killed, but he was killed by a white man.”", "He went on: “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who suffer in our country, whether they be white or whether they be black. . . . Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of his world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.”", "Kennedy’s speech was itself a prayer, a quiet plea for a shared understanding. Its wellsprings were deep in Kennedy’s own experience, after the murder of his brother, John Kennedy, in 1963; the grief he had carried in the years since; all that he had come to understand about the roots of black unrest, the depths of black frustration with the political process, and the growing focus of black communities on self-determination. In Indianapolis, Kennedy had spoken from the heart, without notes, and expected to leave it at that; he planned to suspend his campaign until after King’s funeral. But John Lewis, among other civil-rights leaders, urged him to keep a scheduled appearance the next day at the City Club of Cleveland, and to use the occasion to make a more pointed case for the principle of nonviolence—against a backdrop of rioting and looting that had broken out that night in nearly every major American city except, it turned out, Indianapolis.", "If the Indianapolis speech was a lament, the speech he gave in Cleveland was an indictment—delivered more in sorrow than in anger, but just barely. That morning, April 5th, Kennedy sat down for an interview with Jack Paar, who asked what his reaction had been to King’s assassination. “That more and more people are turning to violence,” Kennedy replied. “And in the last analysis it’s going to destroy our country.” His remarks at the City Club were an elaboration on that theme.", "The audience—mostly white, mostly businessmen—sat in silence as Kennedy condemned “the mindless menace of violence . . . which again stains our land and every one of our lives” and asked why America should continue to “make it easy for men of all shades of sanity to acquire whatever weapons and ammunition they desire.” He continued, “Too often we honor swagger and bluster and the wielders of force; too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of others. . . . Some look for scapegoats, others look for conspiracies, but this much is clear: violence breeds violence, repression brings retaliation, and only a cleansing of our society can remove this sickness from our land.” He spoke, too, of “the violence of institutions: indifference and inaction and slow decay.” He saw “no final answers.” Yet, he said, “we know what we must do.”", "That exhortation, today, is hard to hear. Two months later, Kennedy, as we know, ", " to that menace—as had his brother, as had King, and as have many thousands of other “human beings whom other human beings loved needed,” as R.F.K. said in Cleveland. We still know what we must do. Kennedy’s question to us, which hangs in the air half a century later, is when we will finally bring ourselves to do it."]},

Schools have struggled to keep qualified teachers, many of whom\nleave for states with higher pay, and classes are taught by a string of\nemergency-certified teachers and short-term substitutes.", "Landing in Oklahoma, I immediately started hearing anecdotes about the\nhardships of local educators: from the friend who gets her hair cut by a\nhigh-school history teacher who works in a salon two days a week for\nextra money, or the Lyft driver who says that her kid’s school always\nhas flyers in the hall asking parents to donate paper and pencils and\nother supplies, or the acquaintance who told me that the teachers in her\nfamily joke about developing “teacher bladder,” the ability not to go\nto the restroom all day because there aren’t enough staff members in the\nschool to allow them to leave their classrooms for a few minutes.", "The Oklahoma walkout was stoked by ", ", which closed schools throughout that state for almost two\nweeks and resulted in a five-per-cent raise for teachers there. The\nOklahoma Education Association is demanding nine hundred and forty\nmillion dollars in new funding for education over three years, including\nmoney for teacher salaries and increased spending on school\ninfrastructure and support staff. After rejecting multiple proposals in\nrecent months to raise revenue for education funding, state lawmakers\npassed a bill last week that raised taxes by about four hundred and\nfifty million dollars and increased the pay of Oklahoma teachers, who\nare among the lowest paid in the country, by roughly fifteen per cent on\naverage. It was the first tax increase in Oklahoma in twenty-eight\nyears. In a move that was widely seen as a reaction to a teacher walkout\nand resulting tax hike in 1990, Oklahoma voters passed a ballot measure\nrequiring a seventy-five-per-cent supermajority in the legislature, or a\npublic vote, to pass any tax increase. (Tax cuts, meanwhile, can pass\nwith just a simple majority.) Governor Mary Fallin signed the bill last\nThursday and said, of the state’s teachers, “I hope they can come and\nsay ‘thank you’ on Monday and go back to the classrooms.”", "Newcomb said that the overwhelming reaction among her colleagues to the\nbill’s passage was, “This is not good enough. This is not what we’re\nasking for. We’ll be back where we are in three years.”", "After the tax increase, public opinion shifted, and some who had been on\nthe teachers’ side began to wonder out loud what more the teachers\nwanted, but, on Monday, the walkout went ahead as planned. Thousands of\nteachers showed up at the capitol, many shuttled in by school bus.\nCheers broke out when a union leader said that the tax measure was only\na down payment and the rest of the bill was due. There were boos when\nshe said that the legislature was hoping that the teachers would thank\nthem and go away quietly.", "On Tuesday, the capitol was once again filled with thousands of\nteachers, some of whom took a sick day or a personal day to be there,\nbecause their districts hadn’t officially closed down. (Strikes by\npublic employees are illegal in Oklahoma, so the action is referred to\nas a walkout. School closures have to be negotiated with local school\nboards.)", " By Wednesday, several districts had cancelled school through\nFriday.", "Every teacher I spoke to in the past week said the\nsame thing: they were in it for the long haul, and “this is not about\nthe raise. It’s about the kids.” They told stories of teaching from\nbadly outdated textbooks, or turning to crowdfunding sites to purchase\nbooks for their students or furniture for their classrooms, of passing\nunprepared students on to the next grade because another overcrowded\nclassroom of children would arrive in the fall.", "All day Monday, teachers lined up at the capitol entrance to meet with\ntheir legislators. In the afternoon, I went with Newcomb and two other\nteachers from her district to meet with their representative, a\nfirst-term Republican named Tammy West. The teachers asked West what it\nwould take to get more education funding immediately. West pointed out\nthat education wasn’t the only sector that had undergone punishing state\ncuts. “We’re trying to help everyone,” she said. She talked about\nprevious attempts to fund schools, which had failed because of the\nstate’s supermajority rule. As she framed it, the tax bill that passed\nhad been the culmination of slow, incremental work rather than a response to desperate circumstances. The job of funding\neducation would proceed slowly, and she cautioned that a supermajority\nof legislators would not vote for a second tax increase. “It’s just not\ngoing to happen,” she said.", "Afterward, the teachers said that they found West forthright and\nsincere, and didn’t doubt her personal commitment to the issue, but\nfelt uncertain that progress would ever be made if the educators didn’t\ncamp on legislators’ doorsteps. “I don’t have any confidence that\nanything’s going to get done,” a middle-school teacher named Austin\nRich, who is planning to move to Tennessee soon because of the higher\npay, told me. “It’s not a coincidence that this bill got pushed through\nwhen we said that we’re walking and we’re going to keep walking.”", "One of those who plans to keep walking this week is Kendra Abel, an\nelementary-school art teacher in Oklahoma City. Abel, who told me that\nshe teaches five hundred and fifty-three students, and the funding she\nreceives for their art supplies comes to about two dollars per child per\nyear. She has spent more than five hundred dollars of her own money to\noutfit her classroom this year. She also does things like soaking\ndried-out markers in water to make watercolors, or melting down broken\ncrayon bits at the end of the year to make new ones.", "Abel makes thirty-six thousand dollars a year, although the take-home is\nlower, after paying high insurance premiums. She’s also slowly paying\ndown medical bills from a surgery she had last year. She and her husband\nwould like to have a baby soon, but they’ll probably have to move to\nanother state to afford it. She chokes up as she talks about her own\nchildhood, growing up in poverty in the small town of Stigler, and about\nthe teachers who helped put her on a different path in life.

When the students were released after merchants agreed to desegregate, King was forced to remain in jail and was transported to a prison miles away from Atlanta.

Judges are\nnot instructed to look kindly on military veterans or brilliant\nstudents—they are supposed to prevent the deportation of human beings to\nplaces where they are likely to face persecution or torture.\nSchimanski’s lawyer was arguing that, as a lesbian, Schimanski would\nmore likely than not be persecuted in Russia, probably denied medical\ntreatment, and certainly denied access to methadone, which is illegal in\nRussia. Her original argument for a withholding of removal was denied in\nJanuary, 2015; a subsequent appeal was dismissed in 2016.", "I learned about the case when Schimanski’s family asked me to serve as\nan expert witness, because I have ", " about the persecution of and systematic violence against L.G.B.T. people\nin Russia. In looking into the possibility of testifying, I learned\nthings that I’d never known about immigration court. As a person born\noutside the United States, in order to testify in immigration court I\nwould have to furnish my alien registration number, even though I was\nnaturalized twenty-nine years ago. Immigration court treats\nnaturalization as a fiction: anyone who wasn’t born in the United States\nis Other. In the end, for unrelated reasons, I didn’t testify; instead,\nI was in court as a journalist, and this was why, as Wargo was getting\non the phone with another potential expert witness (he couldn’t make\nit), she asked me to leave the Pro Bono Room. Olga stayed in the room\nwith her, while her daughter and Avery went to the bathroom. I was\nlooking over my notes in the immigration-court waiting area—which, with\nrows of gray-upholstered plastic chairs, looks like the waiting area in\nany bureaucratic office—when Avery ran in.", "“They are putting her in handcuffs and taking her downstairs,” she\nscreamed. She was crying and hyperventilating.", "I followed Avery as", " she ran back to the elevator bank where Schimanski\nhad been taken. Three men who, I later learned, were ", " agents were\ngetting on an elevator with Schimanski. I asked the men why they were\ndetaining her.", "“I’ve seen you on MSNBC,” one of the agents answered, by way of telling\nme that I wouldn’t get an answer.", "Then Schimanski was gone, and the four of us remained in the large\nwaiting area. Avery was crying, repeating over and over, “Does this mean\nI’ll never see her again?” Olga was speaking Russian to me, trying\nsimultaneously to explain and to understand what had just happened. She\nwas convinced that it was somehow Wargo’s fault. Avery agreed. “I don’t\nunderstand,” she said. “She is not telling us enough. She is not\nexplaining something. I don’t understand.”", "Wargo didn’t exactly understand it, either. She knew that Schimanski had\na D.U.I. arrest that technically gave ", " cause to detain her, but the\ntiming was surprising. She had never had a client detained minutes\nbefore that client’s hearing was scheduled to begin.", "Schimanski called from two floors below. Olga put her daughter on\nspeakerphone.", "“My medication,” she kept saying. “My medication, Ma. They don’t give\nyou medication in jail. Now I’m in custody. They are saying I’m not\ngoing to have court today.”", "Olga tried to get her daughter to switch to Russian, to make their\ndiscussion more private, but Schimanski’s Russian wasn’t good enough to\nmaintain a conversation, especially when she was upset.", "“Ma, if they take me to jail, I’m going to need money,” she said. “What\nI’m worried about is my medication. I’m going to die without it. Answer\nyour phone. Turn it on, so you can hear it.” As Olga got ready to hang\nup, Avery asked, “Will you tell her I love her?”", "The hearing, scheduled for 10:30 that morning, began at 10:35.", "“Where is your client?” the immigration judge Michael Straus asked,\naddressing Wargo.", "“She got arrested about fifteen minutes ago,” Wargo answered.", "“Why would you do that?” the judge, visibly irritated, asked the two\nattorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security. “Wouldn’t it\nmake more sense to arrest her after the hearing?”", "“There is a material change in circumstance,” John Marley, the general\nattorney for D.H.S. in Hartford, said.", "“I don’t understand the strategy,” Straus said.", "The judge sounded incensed. Marley seemed amused. Avery was still crying\naudibly.", "Straus was the judge who denied Schimanski’s original plea for a stay of\nremoval two years ago. Now he and Wargo quickly reviewed her filing—more\narticles about worsening conditions for L.G.B.T. people in Russia—and\nthe relevant regulations, which required that Schimanski show that she\nwould most likely face persecution if she returned to Russia. It emerged\nthat the D.U.I. arrest was scheduled to be dismissed, because Schimanski\nhad not actually been driving the car at the time of the arrest and had\nalso complied with all the required classes following the arrest; what’s\nmore, the D.U.I. would not have any bearing on her eligibility for a\nstay of deportation.", "The judge again demanded to know why ", " found it appropriate to arrest\nSchimanski before her scheduled hearing.", "“Obviously, for an individual who’s had a very long career with drugs\nand alcohol, over twenty-five arrests, to have another arrest—she is\nclearly a danger to the public,” Marley said.", "“She doesn’t have a car here!” Straus said, clearly exasperated. “She is\nnot a danger in the courtroom.”", "Avery continued crying.", "At 10:50 the judge gathered his binders and said that he would be right\nback.", "“Are you planning on making a decision, your honor?” Wargo asked.", "“Maybe,” the judge said.", "Now Wargo had an impossible decision to make. She could go downstairs to\nask Schimanski to waive her presence in the courtroom; otherwise, Straus\ncould not legally render a decision. But what if Straus, who had a\nreputation for being tough, and who had already rejected Schimanski’s\nclaim once, was not going to rule in her favor? In that case, Schimanski\nmight be better off not signing the waiver. But this would mean that she\nwould stay in detention, and Olga was claiming that her daughter would\nnot survive without methadone. If she stayed in detention, Schimanski\nwould be moved to Massachusetts—the nearest state with ", " facilities\nfor women—and would then face an immigration judge in Boston. What if\nher chances with that judge were better? At the same time, Straus seemed\nangry at D.H.S. But ", ", even if Straus granted relief, ", " could\nstill hold Schimanski for as long as six months if it chose to appeal\nthe decision. Waiving Schimanski’s presence could unnecessarily risk a\nnegative decision.", "Straus returned at 11 ", " and addressed D.H.S. “Have the background\nchecks been completed?” he asked.", "“No,” Marley said. He explained that a background check had been ordered\nand submitted, but it came back perfectly clean, as though Schimanski\nhad never been arrested. Since the background check was erroneous, it\nwas as good as missing. Without it, the judge could not render a\ndecision. Marley shrugged. The bureaucracy had failed. A person’s fate\nhung in the balance, but the bureaucracy—which Hannah Arendt once\ndescribed as “the rule by Nobody”—can have no shame.", "The judge ordered a new background check and declared a recess until the\nafternoon. Wargo continued to fret over her impossible dilemma. Olga\ncontinued saying that her daughter could not", " survive detention. Avery\ncontinued crying.", "At 1 ", ", Straus demanded to know where Schimanski was. Marley\nexplained that she could not be brought upstairs—she was about to be\ntransported to Massachusetts. But Wargo asked the judge to proceed. With\nno one to advise her, Wargo had decided to ask Schimanski to waive her\npresence. If Straus came back with a denial, that would mean that\nSchimanski would remain in detention, and that is was possible that\nAvery would indeed never see her again. Olga had already decided that if\nher daughter was deported, she, too, would go back to Russia to try to\nsupport her. Olga had a sister there, but relations between them had\nbeen strained for years, ever since the sister had found out that\nSchimanski was a lesbian. It was unclear how they would survive if they\nwent back to Russia, but Olga felt certain that, without her, her\ndaughter couldn’t survive at all.", "Straus announced his decision: he was convinced that, if she returned to\nRussia, Schimanski would more likely than not face persecution. He was\ngranting her application for withholding of removal.", "Instead of celebrating, everyone waited again. Marley had said that the\nD.H.S. might appeal the decision, and this would mean that Schimanski\nwould remain in detention. At that point, it wasn’t even clear to Olga\nand Stephanie if she was still in the building.", "At 3:30 ", ", Olga was contemplating leaving. Just then,\nSchimanski appeared in the waiting room. She had been released. D.H.S.\nhad decided not to appeal. Everyone cried again, for joy and\nhelplessness and fury.", "Olga, her daughter, and Avery drove back to Guilford, where they stayed\nup, giddily and sometimes angrily recounting the details of that day,\nuntil the middle of the night. It seemed, finally, the end of\nSchimanski’s ordeal. Technically, her withholding of removal is\ntemporary; it does not grant her the right to legal permanent residence,\nand she will never be able to leave the country and return. But, generally speaking, people can live with this status their entire lives.", "These days, however, the permanence of Schimanski’s temporary status is\nless certain. Jeff Sessions’s Justice Department is demanding ever more\nand faster deportations from the immigration courts. Just as immigrants\nare the most vulnerable part of the American population—which makes them\nthe perfect target for the bureaucratic sadism of the Trump era—so\nimmigration courts may prove to be the easiest courts for the\nAdministration to subjugate. After all, these courts already treat\nanyone born outside this country as an interloper, and as suspect. It\nmay prove entirely too easy to reframe them as courts that protect this\ncountry from human beings, rather than the other way around."]},

Their goal was to seek asylum in this country or,\nfailing that, to call attention to the widespread violence in their home\ncountries, which had forced them to flee for their lives. On Sunday, the\nhosts of the Fox News morning show “Fox & Friends” placed a call to a\nregular guest named Brandon Judd, the president of the largest\n", " of\nU.S. Border Patrol agents, and asked him to explain what was\nhappening. Judd blamed the governments of the U.S. and Mexico. The\nmigrants knew, he said, that the U.S. would “catch and release” them if\nthey reached the United States, and the Mexican government was assisting\nthe travellers along their route. Neither statement was accurate—eighty\nper cent of Hondurans seeking asylum are turned away at the U.S. border,\nand the Mexican government has hardly been helping the migrants.\nAccording to Judd, the current situation was proof that the flow of\nmigrants would continue because of “Obama holdovers” and congressional Democrats. He urged\nRepublicans to use the “nuclear option” to overcome partisan\nopposition and to pass tougher immigration laws.", "Shortly after the broadcast, President Trump started tweeting. “Border\nPatrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border\nbecause of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release,” he\nwrote. “Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws ", ".”\nThe tweets continued Monday, when the migrants reached Oaxaca, in\nsouthern Mexico. To Trump, the journey of this “caravan”—as media began\ncalling the migrants—activated a long list of personal grievances. He\nreiterated his call to build a border wall (“", "!”); attacked the\nMexican government (“Mexico is doing very little, if not ", " at\nstopping people”); said he would cut off aid money to Honduras;\nthreatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (Mexico’s\n“cash cow”); and claimed that the migrants were coming to “take\nadvantage of ", ",” despite the fact that none of them were eligible for\nthe program.", "It was, by now, a familiar feedback loop: the President, reacting to a\nFox News broadcast, launches a tweet storm that then drives a news\ncycle. Some of the President’s tweets—his threat to penalize the\nHonduran government, his claim that immigration was surging—directly\ncontradicted recent statements made by his own Administration. White\nHouse officials held a conference call with reporters on Monday to try\nto put the President’s tweets in context—and took the opportunity to\ntout some recent accomplishments: earlier this week, the Justice\nDepartment announced a plan to impose quotas on immigration judges to\nspeed up deportations, and new measures are under consideration to make\nit harder for immigrants both to seek asylum and to qualify for legal\nresidency.", "By Tuesday, the Mexican government had deported four hundred of the\nmigrants. Officials were trying to negotiate with the remaining eight\nhundred or so in a small town called Matias Romero, about eight hundred\nmiles south of the U.S. border. It seemed likely that most of the\ngroup’s members would never reach the U.S. Many of the Hondurans said that they would be content to stay in Mexico if they could; their main\nconcern had been escaping the immediate violence at home. One of them\nwas María Elena Colindres Ortega, a Honduran who, until January, had\nbeen a member of the national Congress. “We’ve had to live through a\nfraudulent electoral process,” she told\n", ".\n“We’re suffering a progressive militarization and lack of institutions. . . . They’re\ncriminalizing those who protested.” She was referring to the\ngovernment of Juan Orlando Hernández, who in December won an election he\nhad appeared to\n", " in\nplain sight. The U.S. has continued to support him despite serial\nhuman-rights abuses and brazen authoritarian behavior, in part because\nhe has promised to crack down on criminal gangs and drug trafficking.", "If the Trump Administration wants to restrict immigration from Central\nAmerica, it needs partners in the region. But the President’s outbursts\nare putting crucial relationships at risk, particularly in Mexico, where\npublic support for the government, already dismal, has dropped further\nbecause of perceptions that it’s failed to stand up to Trump. Members of\nthe Trump Administration are in the middle of complex negotiations with\nthe Mexican government at the moment. Both sides are rushing to reach a\npreliminary deal on ", " before a regional summit in Peru, next week.\nJust before the President launched his tweet storm on Sunday, the\nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen,\npublicly lauded the Mexican government for an “excellent” dialogue about\n“shared security and economic interests.” Four years ago, Mexico\ninstituted a policy, called Frontera Sur, that many in the region refer\nto as the “invisible wall”—limiting the flow of migrants north by\napprehending them at Mexico’s southern border and deporting large\nnumbers back to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The “caravan” of\nmigrants that caught Trump’s attention began their recent march in\nTapachula, a Mexican border town that boasts the biggest immigrant-detention center in Latin America.", "The real irony of this story may be that the President’s principal\ngrievance isn’t with the migrants or foreign governments he’s now\npublicly berating but with the Republican-controlled Congress. Last\nmonth, lawmakers passed a budget for the upcoming fiscal year that\nskimped on funding for his", " border wall. Congress gave the Administration 1.6 billion dollars for “fencing” along the U.S.-Mexico border, which\nwas actually in line with what the Administration had requested last\nyear for barriers in California and Texas. But the President’s pet\nproject—his “big, fat, beautiful” wall, for which he wanted twenty-five\nbillion dollars—was ignored. That led Trump to consider seeking funding\nfrom the U.S. military, which was about as likely to pay for the wall as\nMexico ever was. (To keep his options open, Trump tweeted, “Build ", " through M!”)", "On Tuesday, after summoning his Secretary of Defense for a briefing,\nTrump announced that he would dispatch the U.S. military to secure the\nborder. “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be\nguarding our border with the military,” he told reporters at a White\nHouse press conference. “That’s a big step.” The next day, Nielsen\nannounced that Trump would be signing a proclamation to send more\nNational Guardsmen to the border. Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General,\nissued a statement of his own extolling Trump’s leadership. “The\nPresident was clear that this caravan needed to be stopped before it\narrived at our southern border, and his efforts now appear to be\nsuccessful,” he said.

At the\nmeeting, N.R.A. leaders warned the group’s nine hundred and sixty\nthousand members—a fraction of the roughly five million members it has\ntoday—that a gun-control bill proposed by Senator Thomas J. Dodd, of\nConnecticut, days after King’s body was flown from Memphis to Atlanta,\nwould end “the private ownership of all guns.”", "Dodd and other gun-control supporters hoped that King’s death might lead\nto the passage of legislation that had been blocked repeatedly in\nCongress since John F. Kennedy’s assassination. “I hope that this brutal, senseless killing will shock the Congress into\nbacking me in this fight to take the guns from the hands of assassins\nand murderers,” Dodd said.

After King’s\nassassination, riots from Baltimore to Trenton to Louisville stoked a\nvery particular and dramatic fear of black violence, one that could\nspill into the white suburbs. This paranoia bred a conviction among many\nwhites that they should arm themselves and, conversely, that effective\ngun control should restrict black Americans from obtaining guns. “White America, by and large, was not mourning Dr. King, rather it was\nfrightened by the violence which took place in the wake of the\nassassination, and it felt that politicians were too permissive,” the\njournalist David Halberstam observed while travelling with Robert F.\nKennedy to Terre Haute, Indiana, immediately after King’s assassination.", "Dodd’s proposed legislation, the Gun Control Act of 1968, was weakened by\ntwo powerful men on the Senate Judiciary Committee: James Eastland, of\nMississippi, and Strom Thurmond, of South Carolina. Eastland and\nThurmond, staunch segregationists, both came from states where firearms\nplayed an indispensable role in enforcing white supremacy after\nReconstruction.", "That double standard—restrict blacks’ access to weapons, arm\nwhites—didn’t live only in the South. A year before King’s\nassassination, the comparatively liberal state of California passed the\nMulford Act of 1967, banning the display of loaded firearms.

(Two weeks\nago, in Sacramento, police shot Stephon Clark, an unarmed twenty-two-year-old black\nman, eight times, mostly in the back, in his grandmother’s back yard, killing Clark and yet again raising questions about which people have\nthe right to protect themselves.)", "After King’s assassination, in 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy visited\nthe wooded, rural community of Roseburg, Oregon, to make a full-throated\nplea for the gun-reform bill. He was greeted with boos and signs:\n“Protect your rights to keep and bear arms.” The opposition was not\nsurprising, given Oregon’s history. The state was founded as a white\nutopia, the writer Matt Novak recently ", ", where, as one “pioneer”\nsettler put it, “its people believed it should encourage only the best\nelements to come to us, and discourage others.” Granted statehood in\n1859, Oregon “was the only state in the Union admitted with a\nconstitution that forbade black people from living, working, or owning\nproperty there,” Novak wrote. “It was illegal for black people even to\n", " to the state until 1926.”", "Eleven days after being heckled by the crowd in Oregon, Kennedy was\nmurdered, in California, by a gunman. That fall, horror in the aftermath\nof the assassinations of King and Kennedy finally created the momentum\nfor Congress to pass Dodd’s bill. Fear of black violence helped stoke\npublic support for it. Opposition from N.R.A.-backed members of Congress\nalso resulted in the removal of one of the bill’s most powerful\nmeasures: calls to register all guns in the United States.", "At an October 22, 1968, signing ceremony for the bill, President Lyndon B. Johnson\nlamented the gun lobby’s success at diluting the measure. “We just could\nnot get the Congress to carry out the requests we made of them. I asked\nfor the national registration of all guns and the licensing of those who\ncarry those guns. For the fact of life is that there are over a hundred\nand sixty million guns in this country—more firearms than families,”\nJohnson said. “The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the\nvoices of an aroused nation. They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a\ngun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year.”", "The Kennedys’ home-town paper, the Boston ", ", hoped that the N.R.A.\nwould get “its first real comeuppance” in the slain reverend’s wake.

Since 2009, amid injuries, personal scandals, and relatively few victories, Woods has finished in the top five at the Masters three times, and has occasionally flashed glimpses of the player he used to be, the man who won the tournament four times, and who is, by all accounts, the most talented golfer ever. Each time, though, the hope has soured—and, after 2013, the last time he won a tournament, Woods’s inconsistent play and frequent signs of acute physical discomfort became painful to watch. It was almost a relief when the Masters arrived in 2016 and 2017, and Woods wasn’t there: fans were spared the sight of him suffering through the agony of mediocrity. Last May, a month after another in a series of back surgeries, he was found passed out behind the wheel of his car, at three in the morning, in Florida; a ", " revealed that he had been taking painkillers, anti-anxiety medication, and sleeping pills. He was arrested, and the resulting mug shot, in which he looked haggard and dazed, represented his nadir as a public figure. The question, at last, shifted from when he might finally come back to whether he might finally come to terms with going away.", "The answer, it seems, is not yet. April has come again, and golf fans are in thrall to another Tiger comeback, this time marked by improved physical health (following what Woods has called a “", "” spinal fusion surgery last year), startlingly competitive play (in his last three tournaments, he’s finished twelfth, tied for second, and tied for fifth), and an unreservedly cheerful outlook from the man himself. “I got a ", ",” he has said. “I am a walking miracle.”", "Tiger’s latest resurgence is well timed to the publication of a new biography, by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian, authoritatively titled “Tiger Woods.” It opens on its own supernatural note: Woods’s father, Earl, once proclaimed to ", " that his son was “the Chosen One.” The book, which charts Woods’s path from divine blessing—the toddler with the perfect drive—to exile, is comprehensive, propulsive, packed with incident (the authors interviewed more than two hundred and fifty people, though not Woods himself), and unsparing with regard to its subject.", "Woods, as most Tiger-watchers will not be surprised to learn, is aloof and ungracious, a lousy tipper, an indifferent friend, and a terrible husband. An interview with his first girlfriend, Dina Gravell, whom Woods dumped in a letter that reads like a hostage note, is particularly devastating. The authors don’t hesitate to moralize. “He didn’t know how to love and be loved as a human being,” they write. Of his golfing trophies, they suggest, “In a way, they were his best friends, the objects he’d devoted his life to acquiring.” In a passage devoted to his public sex scandal, they declare, “At thirty-three, he was untethered from his family by a narcissism that fed his self-destructive addictions to bodybuilding, painkillers, sleeping pills, and sex.”", "There are, it turns out, many different ways to call a person a jerk. The image of Woods that Benedict and Keteyian present is that of an ill-formed and incomplete person, living a cloistered life of transactional relationships and nondisclosure agreements—a perpetual man-child most at ease lifting weights, playing video games, or, as he got older and lost himself to delusion, leveraging his fame to participate in real-life “urban-warfare training” with Navy ", "s. The authors pin much of the blame for all this on Woods’s parents, Earl, a Vietnam veteran and retired lieutenant colonel in the Army, and Kultida, whom Earl met while stationed in Thailand. “Tiger’s inability to show gratitude, apologize, or express appreciation was rooted in his warped upbringing,” they write, noting that Earl used psychological-warfare tactics to instill toughness in his son, while Kultida smothered him and insisted he be wary of others and keep them at a distance.", "Earl comes off especially badly. Many of the details about his behavior are not new: pushing Tiger to practice for hours a day when he was two; booking him on “", "” before he turned three; claiming, ridiculously, the year Tiger turned pro, that his son “will do more than any other man in history to change the course of humanity.” But the book is strongest when it draws on original reporting. Benedict and Keteyian make a compelling case that two of the foundational stories of Woods’s younger years—a vicious hate crime allegedly perpetrated against him on his first day of kindergarten, and a mugging he reportedly experienced during his freshman year at Stanford—have little basis in fact and were part of Earl’s ", " mythmaking. The authors also reveal that Earl, who died in 2006, is buried in an unmarked grave in Manhattan, Kansas, which is jarring to learn, given the outsized role that he played in Tiger’s life, the fact that Tiger often cited him as his best friend, and the enduring image of Earl embracing his son after Woods won his first Masters, in 1997, and tearfully repeating the phrase, “We made it.” In a rare moment of restraint, the authors do not speculate much about why", " Earl Woods is not memorialized. The plain fact of it is haunting enough.", "What’s missing from the book is a sustained consideration of Woods’s genius, and his undeniable appeal. Why did forty million people tune in to hear Woods, in 2010, offer a grovelling public apology for a string of extramarital affairs? Why has Woods’s latest return to form boosted television ratings to levels not seen since the last time he was this good?", "The authors write that Woods’s adultery scandal shattered “his image as an elite athlete with a sparkling reputation,” but, as they document throughout the book, his public reputation was more complicated than that from the start. He always rubbed some people, and especially journalists, the wrong way. The public knew about his coldness, his secrecy, and his short fuse (though not his sexting habits) long before he became tabloid fodder. People were skeptical of his overbearing father and the marketing of his backstory; activists criticized him for his lack of public engagement on racial issues; he was even mocked for ", ".", "And yet, he was, if not a beloved figure, then something more: the object of cultural obsession. “In the eyes of fans, winning and greatness in athletics overshadow frailties in human character,” Benedict and Keteyian write, by way of explaining Woods’s popularity. But the public’s infatuation with Woods was not merely the result of his dominant play. Many of those drawn to Woods don’t even care about the sport. Part of Woods’s fame owed to the cleverness of the corporations that marketed him, especially Nike, but his beguiling  charisma predated and transcended his brand. There is no single quality that explains it. It has to do with his racial identity, his body, his clothes, the way he stands, and walks, and swings, and fist-pumps, and smiles.", "It is hard to root against Tiger Woods—this was true when he was twenty-one, brash and golden, and  it is still true now, when he is forty-two and wounded. Not only does Woods so clearly want to win, but just by being himself, he seems somehow to deserve it, too. Like Michael Jordan, or Serena Williams, or Roger Federer, he upended the sports trope of rooting for the underdog—he seems to play on a grander, more historic plane than his competitors, and when a lesser player beats him it feels like a wasted moment, a narrative glitch, a cosmic error. At several points, Benedict and Keteyian refer to Woods as a golfing “machine”: stiff, calculating, rehearsed. But there is nothing machine-like about Woods’s stalking of the course, his once wild celebrations, the cruelty he inflicts on himself when he fails. The writers come closer to capturing his effect when they refer to his artistry—his “imagination, touch, and control”—as when, on the sixteenth hole of the final round of the 2005 Masters, he chipped from off the green, his ball rolling on a perfect line and carrying just enough speed to gently tumble, after a dramatic pause, into the hole. Other golfers have made harder shots, but Woods seems to generate, around the stillness of the game, a crackling energy and sense of possibility.", "The authors frame his story as a cautionary tale. “Earl and Kultida created an alternative universe for their son, one where they were in control and he was the little boy emperor who was going to be the best in the world at one thing,” they write. “In the process, they took away some of Tiger’s humanity and replaced it with skills.” Yet although Woods may be socially stunted, and even, perhaps, as the authors suggest, profoundly unhappy, it’s impossible to think of the performances he has given the world as anything other than deeply human. Woods’s humanity may be of an unusual sort, the kind that falters in everyday life but flourishes under the brightest lights. He seems to have shut out the people closest to him, but, for more than twenty years, he has lived a more generous life in public—exposed, vulnerable, and impossible not to watch."]},

Votel, who heads Central Command operations, candidly told the conference. “There is a military role in this, certainly in the stabilization phase.”", "Even as the panel was still speaking, Trump was holding a press conference, a few blocks away, with the Presidents of the three Baltic states. He was visibly angry when asked about Syria. “I want to get out,” he ", ", his voice rising. “I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation. We will have, as of three months ago, spent seven trillion dollars in the Middle East over the last seventeen years. We get nothing—nothing out of it, nothing.” He called it “a horrible thing.”", "“So it’s time,” Trump said. “We were very successful against ", ". We’ll be successful against anybody militarily. But sometimes it’s time to come back home.”", "Every Administration has had deep internal rifts; every President wants to get the troops home as soon as possible. But the total disconnect—so highly public—between the President and his top advisers on strategy to confront a major threat to national security stunned Washington. Just this week, U.S. troops were ", " building new frontline positions and bringing more equipment, including construction material, into Syria to improve their capabilities.", "Trump made the same argument when the National Security Council met later that afternoon. The President was still cranky. With the recent firing of both his Secretary of State and national-security adviser—and with their successors not yet in place—the generals took the lead. James Mattis, the Defense Secretary; General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Votel tried to persuade Trump to stay the course in Syria for another year or two. They argued that if the area under control of U.S.-backed forces—in almost a quarter of the country—is not stabilized, ", " could make a comeback. Stabilization involves everything from turning water and electricity back on to clearing thousands of deadly mines and fostering local governance councils—steps allowing the return of life to war-ravaged areas. The failure to fully stabilize Iraq before the U.S. pulled out in 2011—notably brokering a power-sharing agreement among rival communities—contributed to political alienation and the rise of ", " there.", "Trump’s advisers also argued that withdrawal could diminish the U.S.-led coalition’s leverage in a political settlement to end the war. It could lessen pressure on President Bashar al-Assad—whose ruthless response to peaceful protests sparked a war that has killed half a million people and left more than half of the country’s twenty-two million residents displaced—to make concessions. The State Department issued a scathing condemnation of the Assad regime on Wednesday, the first anniversary of Syria’s chemical-weapons attack on civilians in Khan Sheikhoun, which killed or injured hundreds of men, women, and children. A year after Trump launched a cruise-missile strike in response to the chemical attack and declared that “no child of God should ever suffer such horror,” the State Department said, “There has been no let-up in the atrocities committed by the Syrian regime, enabled by its backers, in flagrant violation of international law.”", "Yet Trump, in the White House meeting, dismissed argument after argument about a longer timetable to finish the mission in Syria. A premature withdrawal, Trump’s advisers posited, would also take the United States out of the game in a country that is the geostrategic center of the Middle East—and borders five countries allied with the U.S.", "The generals warned that an already complex war in Syria, now beginning its eighth year, would get even more complicated. They cited the dangers of the Assad regime or other foreign powers—including Iran and its allies in Hezbollah—filling the vacuum in areas that U.S. troops have worked so hard to help liberate. Without the constant threat of U.S. airpower, Russia could feel emboldened to operate in a broader swath of territory. Turkey recently intervened in northern Syria in a", " campaign targeting U.S. allies—drawing them away from the war against ", ". A decision to pull out could also strand the Kurds, whose forces have fought most fiercely against ", " in Syria.", "Trump was unconvinced by—and impatient with—the advice, sources familiar with the debate told me. More than once he said, “Why do I have to be the one to do this?” one told me.", "Trump’s Republican allies in Congress have warned him against premature withdrawal. “It’d be the single worst decision the President could make,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Fox News on Sunday. “We got ", " on the ropes. You want to let ’em off the ropes, remove American soldiers,” Graham said, using another term for the Islamic State. “This is a disaster in the making,” he said. “There are over three thousand ", " fighters still roaming around Syria.

The appeals seemed only to further irritate Trump. Just hours earlier, he had referred publicly to his recent conversation with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. “Well, you know, you want us to stay—maybe you’re going to have to pay,” Trump said, at the press conference.", "The President’s calculation sometimes seemed to be exactly that—transactional, or from a ledger. At one point, he said that the United States should not be building bridges in Raqqa when it wasn’t building them in Wisconsin, the well-placed source told me. No argument changed his mind.", "On Wednesday, the White House issued a terse four-sentence statement announcing the outcome of the National Security Council meeting. “The military mission to eradicate ", " in Syria is coming to a rapid end,” it began.

Some demonstrators encroached on what the Army has designated a prohibited area, three hundred metres in front of the fence. Others slung rocks, or burned tires. Since the demonstrations began, including clashes over the past seven days, nineteen Palestinians have been shot and killed, and a thousand have been wounded, according to reports from Gaza hospitals. Another march is called for Friday. Hamas, which has organized it, hopes to bring out as many as ", ", and eventually, week by week, turn the demonstrations into a cause the civilized world, such as it is, cannot ignore.", "The soldiers’ use of live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators prompted the U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, to call for “an independent and transparent investigation.” A ", " editorial called the gunfire “excessive.” The Israeli civil-rights groups B’Tzelem (“In the Image,” as in “image of God”) and Shovrim Shtika (“Breaking the Silence”) have called on soldiers to refrain from shooting. But for most Israelis the soldiers’ shoot-to-kill response seems no more than business as usual, comparable to the actions of the military when Palestinian-refugee demonstrators tried to storm the border in the Golan Heights, in 2011, leaving twenty dead and hundreds wounded. The demonstrators are talking about “return,” after all, and infiltrators in the past have murdered civilians. Hamas organized dozens of suicide bombings in restaurants and buses in its thirty-year history, and, since it took control of Gaza, in 2007, has launched hundreds of missiles into civilian areas.", "“They all talk about destroying and hating Israel, and about returning refugees to Safed, to Haifa, to Jaffa,” the Israeli Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, ", ", after the killing of demonstrators. Lieberman is notoriously hard-line, but the leaders of the government’s centrist opposition, Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid, and Labor’s Avi Gabbay, ", " on this. Gaza, they know, unites the Israeli public and makes it sore. When ", ", a veteran broadcaster on Israeli Army Radio, spoke of being “ashamed to be Israeli” after the shootings, he quickly retreated in the face of the backlash, apologizing for offending the soldiers and speaking “before he had all the information.” Of major parties, only the Arab Joint List has condemned the Army for its fire.", "There is no question that many Gazans are suffering, and that the demonstrations are an expression of desperation; for years, the press has reported on electricity being restricted to a few hours a day, and of the imminent collapse of systems supplying water and sewerage. About half of Palestinian youth are unemployed, and large numbers of children ", ". But, when Lieberman talks of “they” and their hatred, he is calling attention to Hamas’s decade-long rule of Gaza. Most Israelis suppose, not without cause, that Hamas is committed to a severe Islamist theocracy, and armed struggle against Israel, or against any Palestinian willing to reconcile with it. Of Gaza’s 1.8 million tightly packed residents, two-thirds are refugees, or the descendants of refugees, from what is now Israel. Israelis also assume that most Gazans heedlessly back Hamas and its program.", "Hamas’s military wing has, in the past, hidden missile sites in populated areas, knowing that these could be bombed. If it is prepared to use such “human shields” to deter attack, could it not use human sacrifices to gain a public-relations victory? “Anyone who approaches the fence endangers his life, and I would recommend that Gaza residents put their efforts not into protesting against Israel but into regime change within the Strip,” Lieberman said. So Gaza has become something of a black box for the Israeli public, the inputs known—siege and periodic repression—the outputs known, depravation and periodic defiance. Hamas’s motives are presumably indistinguishable from its capabilities: if it gains the power to injure Israel it will do so, as if by reflex. Its popularity is presupposed. The harsh and consistent Israeli inputs are meant to bring Gazans to their senses. What’s unknown, because it is largely unexamined, except by military intelligence, is Hamas’s strategy after more than a decade of ruling the Strip—is it still wedded to ceaseless violence or does it have a growing incentive to pursue a nonviolent mass mobilization?", "Hamas has a new leader, ", ", elected in February, 2017, who, unlike past Hamas leaders, knows Hebrew, having spent twenty-three years in Israeli prisons. He is notoriously tough, having personally hunted and executed “collaborators,” yet, according to Avi Issacharoff, a journalist specializing in Palestinian affairs, he is “not an adventurer”—he does not want another war. At the same time, he cannot cope with the status quo as his predecessors have. The situation in Gaza is, indeed, dreadful. Then-I.D.F. Military Intelligence chief, Herzl Halevi, told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in February, 2016: “The humanitarian condition in Gaza is progressively deteriorating, and if it blows up, it’ll be in Israel’s direction.” Halevi agreed with a U.N. report that the Strip will be uninhabitable by 2020. The situation is so extreme, and so ominous for Israel, that Lieberman himself proposed a U.N. mandate back in 2014. Transportation Minister Israel Katz—a potential rival to lead the Likud if Benjamin Netanyahu is forced", " out by corruption investigations—has been advancing the idea of Israel unilaterally building an artificial island off the coast of Gaza that could serve as a port under Israeli inspection.", "Meanwhile, Sinwar is increasingly boxed in by Egypt’s President, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who controls access to this border, and has shut down most of Hamas’s trade—and, hence, its revenue—through the tunnels to Egypt. Sisi overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas’s mentors, and wants—the journalist Danny Rubinstein told me—to stabilize Gaza, preferably, with the Palestinian Authority’s coöperation, so that Egypt can fight ", " in the Sinai: “Sisi has millions of people waking up every morning unsure if they will eat that day,” Rubinstein says. “He has lost patience with Palestinians complaining about settlers stealing an olive orchard here and there. He wants to be sure that Hamas is not giving ", " aid and comfort.” Sisi would even be willing to coöperate with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s rival, Mohammed Dahlan, who has been lavishly funded by sources in the Emirates, if Dahlan could bring Hamas into a coöperative framework that would stabilize Gaza and allow for its rehabilitation. “Sisi wants to recruit Hamas into his fight, not the other way around,” Rubinstein says.", "Abbas, for his part, has been trying to drive Sinwar into a corner. Sinwar knows that Hamas is not nearly as popular as the Israeli public assumes. The ", " by Khalil Shikaki’s Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, which has itself been at odds with Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, puts Hamas’s popularity in Gaza at perhaps thirty per cent, roughly the same as Fatah’s. Both parties are blamed for the failure of reconciliation talks. Hamas has slightly moderated its views, ", " last May to entertain, as part of a “national consensus,” an independent state in the 1967 borders. But Abbas has insisted that, if the P.A. is to manage and to fund civil services and police in Gaza, pay for the fuel that generates electricity—and give Israel sufficient grounds to relieve the siege—Hamas’s military wing, reportedly as many as thirty thousand armed cadres, must disarm. The demonstrations are a way to escape Abbas’s cornering. For the first time, Hamas may plausibly see nonviolent mass struggle as its only option to break the Israeli blockade and to force a reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority on its terms.", "“What Israelis do not understand is that Hamas was determined to keep the demonstrations totally nonviolent. They want the largest possible participation,” Shikaki told me in an interview, in Ramallah. “They are busing people in. But you don’t see Hamas’s flags or anybody else’s flags. The march is an indication, not just of Hamas influence but of huge public discontent Hamas itself must contend with.” He said a goal of the demonstrations could be to remind the world of the stresses of life in Gaza under the Israeli blockade, forgotten especially since the Trump Administration took office, and use them to potentially “gain the right to send agricultural produce to the West Bank, or make it possible for Gazans to travel again, to Jordan—to breathe again.”", "Hamas, manifestly, cannot control all the young people at the border; Islamic Jihad has a different command structure, and, just two weeks ago, was foiled trying to attack an Israeli naval vessel. But Shikaki argues that Hamas, for its strategy to work, must try to eliminate casualties altogether. Ironically, Hamas wants Israeli military professionals, who warn of explosion, to gain the upper hand in their dispute with the Netanyahu government. “If things escalate, the P.A. will be pointing a finger: O.K., you organized this, now how are you going to respond? You go to war, services totally collapse. You fail to respond, you look weak and reckless. The idea is to give people a chance to vent without violence—that is the balance Hamas has to maintain.” Hamas will never disarm, Shikaki added, and it is unrealistic for the Palestinian Authority or Israel to expect its members to do so. “They know that their arms, their military ‘steadfastness,’ their armaments infrastructure, are what really differentiates them from Fatah in the minds of their supporters. Fatah is for internationalization and diplomacy; Hamas for struggle. But it wants to show that it can nevertheless conduct a nonviolent struggle—force Abbas to agree to reconciliation on their terms, without disarming.”", "Israelis remain deeply skeptical and are bracing for acts of terror. In 2006, Ehud Olmert offered Hamas the chance to become a normalized political party—", " it renounced violence, accepted international agreements, and, so, in effect, recognized Israel, none of which it was prepared to do. But Hamas is actually out of options, much like Abbas is. Moreover, Shikaki says, Hamas has “been in government.” It has made clear it is willing to “respect,” but not accept, the conditions under which the P.A., and the Palestine Liberation Organization, have entered into negotiations. “What does Israel want?,” Shikaki says, “A humanitarian disaster? New escalation? A war every three years?” Responding to the Gaza demonstrations with such violence, Shikaki implies, is certainly not in Israel’s interest. “This is a process, with Hamas getting drawn into the responsibilities of governing, and signalling to the Amy and others in the Israeli government who are willing to think more creatively.

The images\nthat have circulated are of textbooks so old that they must be held together\nby duct tape.

Together, these two concerns occupy so much of the horizon\nthat it is difficult to see much else. Mueller is following his own private timeline, discernible to the public\nonly in glimpses. But the midterms are beginning to take shape—or, at\nleast, the stakes of the elections are. Since the ascendance of the Tea Party, in\n2010 (and, in some places, since long before then), politics in many parts of the\ncountry have been arranged", " around a program of cutting taxes and\nradically limiting governmental services.

In the past few\nmonths, Democrats have continued to win special elections in places\nwhere they used to lose handily. Thousands of people have declared\nthemselves candidates for public office. And the confidence of teachers\nin red states has grown: in Oklahoma, they rejected an offered\nfifteen-per-cent pay raise; in Arizona, they are demanding a\ntwenty-per-cent hike. Those are not the bargaining positions of people\nwho assume that the public will abandon them. It is the posture of those\nwho assume, like the student activists from Parkland, that they are\ntaking the common-sense position, that, even in red states, they have\nbehind them a critical mass of support.

The increasingly extreme Republican\nregimes of this decade—Scott Walker’s in Wisconsin, Sam Brownback’s in\nKansas, Mary Fallin’s in Oklahoma, and Paul Ryan’s and Donald Trump’s in\nWashington—have tended to act as if narrow electoral majorities were a\nmandate for vast political change, and as if those groups who supported\ntheir opponents should have no voice at all. For the past decade, these politics have redesigned actual towns\nand cities, leaving them with books with rotting bindings and schools\nthat close on Fridays because they can’t afford anything more.

This new agency should have worked in the developer’s favor, but government appraisers had given the black enclave a grade of D, or “hazardous,” and had colored it red on a map, making any homes the developer built in the area ineligible for F.H.A. assistance. Undeterred, the developer devised a compromise: in exchange for federal financial assistance, the developer would build a concrete wall—six feet high, a foot thick, and a half-mile long—separating the black enclave from the proposed white subdivision. The agency accepted the deal, and the wall still stands today.", "As recent work by the economists Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, and Lawrence Katz has shown, neighborhoods have an enormous influence on their residents’ potential for success. According to ", ", moving from a high-poverty neighborhood to a low-poverty neighborhood raised incomes by thirty-one per cent, improved college attendance, and reduced teen-age pregnancy.", "Detroit’s segregation wall demonstrates the role that the federal government played in separating the races throughout the nation. The segregation that we continue to see today didn’t happen by accident. It was the result of official policy. Federal appraisal maps used racial classifications. The F.H.A. refused to guarantee black buyers’ mortgages. Public housing—which depended on federal funds—was explicitly segregated by race. The F.H.A. supported the use of racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale of private homes to buyers of color.", "The Fair Housing Act was meant to do two things: outlaw individual acts of housing discrimination and foster integration. It was the first time that Congress declared it illegal for private individuals to discriminate on the basis of race in the sale or rental of housing. This was no small thing. An early civil-rights statute, adopted in 1866, said that all citizens “shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,” but this protection was treated as addressing only government action. Before 1968, it was assumed to be perfectly legal for owners to refuse to sell homes to black families, or for a private bank to deny a potential black homebuyer a loan, or for a broker to lie and say that no homes were available.", "The law successfully made these individual acts of explicit racial discrimination in housing transactions illegal, and residential segregation by race has since declined. But the Fair Housing Act has never fully delivered on its promise to promote and further integration.", "Walter Mondale, one of the statute’s principal sponsors, said that the Fair Housing Act was intended to replace ghettos “by truly integrated and balanced living patterns.” But in 1968 residential segregation was stratospherically high. Whites were deeply committed to it. They used all legal and illegal means, including cross burnings, arson, and physical attacks, to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods. They formed thousands of homeowner organizations, complete with block captains, with the express purpose of keeping blacks out of white neighborhoods. And when these methods failed, they simply moved to suburbs.", "It would have taken a remarkably strong federal statute, loaded with every enforcement measure in the book, to combat a social problem of that magnitude. And those measures are exactly what the Fair Housing Act didn’t have. The final bill included significant compromises that limited the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s enforcement capabilities. It also put", " the burden of enforcement on the victims, requiring them to either file a formal complaint with ", " or sue in federal court to vindicate their rights.", "Had its goal of promoting integration been implemented, the Fair Housing Act would have had the potential to be an extraordinary anti-segregation weapon. Instead, it was obstructed from the very beginning. Shortly after the law was enacted, the ", " Secretary George Romney, as part of his Open Communities program, tried to require that a white Detroit suburb accept affordable housing in exchange for federal funds. His efforts failed miserably: President Nixon killed the initiative, and Romney eventually resigned. ", " effectively refused to enforce that provision of the statute for the next forty-five years.", "Late in President Barack Obama’s second term, in 2015, ", " adopted meaningful regulations that put teeth in the Fair Housing Act’s mandate to foster integration. The new rules focussed on enhancing access to good schools, jobs, transportation, recreation, and social services. The regulations had strict time lines, which held both the local jurisdictions and ", " accountable. Fair-housing advocates rejoiced. Then came the election of Donald Trump. In January of this year, ", " Secretary Ben Carson announced that the department would postpone the Obama-era requirements until at least 2020.", "Just before the Fair Housing Act was passed, the Kerner Commission warned that the nation was “moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” To prevent that, it recommended that the nation enact a comprehensive federal open-housing law. And we did. But we have failed to meaningfully enforce it. The reality is that blacks and whites—even those with similar incomes—still largely live in separate worlds, with separate opportunities and separate schools.", "Today, the segregation wall in Detroit is covered with a multicolored mural depicting neighborhood children, Detroit Tigers, Sojourner Truth, and images from the civil-rights movement. Mostly, it is a reminder of one of America’s many unfulfilled promises."]},

The android-smooth forehead, now thirty-three years old, still appeared unmarked by age or adversity, but there were no flip-flops or pajamas this time; a small loosening of Zuckerberg’s Facebook-blue tie knot was his only variation from the Capitol’s accepted forms.", "Despite this evident preparation, Zuckerberg did not have much in the way of answers. Two Senate committees wanted to know how Zuckerberg had allowed the data of tens of millions Americans to be misused—an oversight that may have tilted the outcome of a Presidential election—which went unaddressed for years. They wanted to know how Zuckerberg squared his claim that ", "’s user data belongs to the user with the methods his company uses to extract forty billion dollars each year from that trove. Zuckerberg exercises an unprecedented degree of control over the personal information of Facebook’s two billion users, and senators wanted to know if these vassals were in good hands.", "“Why should we let you self-regulate?” Senator Lindsey Graham demanded. A few moments before, he’d asked, “You don’t think you have a monopoly?” Zuckerberg parried, “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me.” Not for the first time, he said that he was personally sorry. He repeatedly referred to Facebook’s beginnings in his Harvard dorm room, as though the company’s modest origins could justify anything that might have gone catastrophically wrong in the meantime.", "Asked repeatedly about the eighty-seven million people affected by the ", " data grab, Zuckerberg said that he himself did not know where those users were located. He said that Facebook could not yet verify the identity of firms running political ads. “We’re working on that now,” he said. He dismissed the notion that Facebook accesses users’ phone audio as “a conspiracy theory” before clarifying that it was not being used “for ads.” He refused to say whether Facebook tracks individual devices without user contact. He wouldn’t say whether all users, or even children, should have to actively consent, or “opt in,” before their data is shared with outside firms. Nor would he say whether Facebook tracks users’ online activity after they log off.", "Some of the sharpest questioning came from Senator Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, regarding a consent decree Facebook reached with the Federal Trade Commission for deceiving users who believed their information would be kept private. Blumenthal said that the Cambridge Analytica debacle violated the 2011 agreement. By some calculations, that would make Facebook liable for trillions of dollars in penalties. Zuckerberg claimed that he had complied with the F.T.C. agreement. “It certainly appears that we should have been aware of that app developer,” he allowed, referring to Global Science Research, or GSR, the subcontractor that harvested the private friends-only data and turned it over to Cambridge Analytica. GSR’s “app” was a quiz that paid unwitting users for access to their friends’ data. One of GSR’s owners, Joseph Chancellor, now works at Facebook. Senator Blumenthal asked if Zuckerberg had disciplined anyone at Facebook for approving GSR’s access to Facebook’s user base. Zuckerberg said he had not.", "Zuckerberg hedged his answers to many yes-or-no questions with “generally” or “my team will get back to you” or concerns about working out “the details.” He repeatedly fell back on Facebook’s utopian rhetoric of “community” and “connecting.” He said that the use of social media in part to help fuel attacks on Rohingya people in Myanmar would be solved by thousands of new multilingual moderators assisted by artificial intelligence. He was “optimistic” that A.I. could be doing this work within five or ten years.", "Zuckerberg’s failure to master the details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal only became apparent for a moment, when Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, asked why he didn’t ban the company from Facebook in 2015, immediately after the first reports of the data misuse. Zuckerberg said that he had done so, only to return after a recess and correct his testimony. In fact, Cambridge Analytica had continued to work closely with the ", " campaign through the election. So had employees from Facebook’s own election-sales team. “Twenty-seven months,” Senator Kamala Harris, of California, said, emphasizing how long it took for Facebook to notify its own users.", "Again and again, Zuckerberg referred to “a broader responsibility”—one that Facebook had failed to recognize, but one that it was now ready to assume. The company would do more than build “tools” for users; it would make sure those tools were used for “good.” Facebook’s responsibility is indeed broad. Zuckerberg controls sixty per cent of Facebook’s voting shares; his monopoly over the daily flows of human consciousness now rivals John Rockefeller’s control of the oil markets. The scope of this responsibility is especially striking when compared to Facebook’s admitted failure to protect personal data. Facebook has had plenty of practice at briskly apologizing, even as it explains why it is entitled to second, third, and fourth chances. Congress may give Zuckerberg yet another pass. Or, if the senators finally move beyond posturing, they may decide it is time to write some new laws that protect users."]},

One of the employees involved said, “There’s no question it was done as a favor to continue to protect Trump from these potential secrets. That’s black-and-white.”", "A.M.I.’s thirty-thousand-dollar payment to Sajudin appears to be the third instance of Trump associates paying to suppress embarrassing stories about the candidate during the 2016 Presidential race. In August, 2016, A.M.I. paid ", ", a former ", " model, a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for her story about a nine-month affair with Trump, and then never published an article about it. (A.M.I. said her story was not credible.) In October, 2016, Trump’s personal attorney, ", ", paid Stephanie Clifford, an adult-film actress who performs under the name ", ", a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to keep her account of an affair with Trump secret. (Clifford’s agreement was distinct from McDougal’s in that it was arranged directly with Cohen. A.M.I. was not party to the contracts between Cohen and Clifford that have been released.)", "Two of the former A.M.I. employees said they believed that Cohen was in close contact with A.M.I. executives while the company’s reporters were looking into Sajudin’s story, as Cohen had been during other investigations related to Trump. “Cohen was kept up to date on a regular basis,” one source said. Contacted by telephone on Wednesday, Cohen said that he was not available to talk. Subsequent efforts to reach him were unsuccessful. On Monday, F.B.I. agents raided Cohen’s hotel and office.

Reporters had staked out the homes of the alleged mother and daughter. The company had also hired an outside private investigator named Michael Mancuso, a former criminal investigator and the owner of Searching for the Truth Investigative Services, who administered the lie-detector test. (Mancuso declined a request for comment.) Lie-detector tests are notoriously flawed, and the test assessed only whether Sajudin had heard the story, not whether there was truth to the underlying claim.", "Sharon Churcher, one of the lead A.M.I. reporters on the story, told me, “I do not believe that story was true. I believed from the beginning it was not true.” Other employees at A.M.I. had questions about Sajudin’s credibility. In 2014, a ", " registered through a service that obscures the identity of the author claimed that Sajudin had made similar accusations against a Trump Tower", " resident named Lawrence Penn III, and that those accusations were false. (Penn could not be reached for comment. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud, and he is currently serving a six-year prison sentence. Penn’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.) When I reached out to Sajudin, he responded, in an e-mail, “My time is valuable. What’s your offer??” After being told that ", " does not pay sources, Sajudin declined further requests for an interview.", "Although many of the A.M.I. sources I spoke with expressed skepticism about Sajudin’s claims, all six agreed that A.M.I. made a concerted effort to shut down the story. Several said that they believed the coverup, rather than the story itself, was of public importance. One told me that, after the polygraph came back positive, “the decision was made at a high level to pay this source those funds and to put this thing to rest without an investigation taking place.” A.M.I.’s decision was unusual even in the context of the company’s other efforts to purchase stories in order to bury them, a practice known as “catch and kill.” Another source, who believed that A.M.I. suppressed the story to help Trump, said of Sajudin, “It’s unheard of to give a guy who calls A.M.I.’s tip line big bucks for information he is passing on secondhand. We didn’t pay thousands of dollars for non-stories, let alone tens of thousands. It was a highly curious and questionable situation.”", "A.M.I. later attempted to prevent other outlets from reporting on the story or the company’s payout. In the summer of 2017, the Associated Press began investigating A.M.I.’s suppression of the story.

Davis and Howard met with a reporter, an editor, and a lawyer from the Associated Press. Citing attorney-client privilege, Davis said that he could not reveal the legal advice he gave Howard, but he described some of what happened in the meeting. Davis told me that Howard presented the A.P. with claims that cast doubt on Sajudin’s character, including the allegations on the anonymous Web site. “When Dylan told me he had these documents and he hoped he would kill the story, my opening statement was, ‘I am not here to kill any story. That’s not what I do for a living,’ ” Davis told me. “I encouraged my client, Mr. Howard, to reveal what he had about the source of the story.” Davis said he told the A.P., “It’s up to you to decide whether to write the story as a ‘he says, he says’ or not.” At the time, the A.P. did not run the story.", "On Wednesday, thirty minutes after ", " contacted A.M.I. for comment about the payment to Sajudin, Radar Online, an A.M.I. publication, posted ", " acknowledging the thirty-thousand-dollar payment but saying that the former doorman’s story was false. The Radar Online piece quoted Howard saying, “When we realized we would be unable to publish, and other media outlets approached the source about his tale, we released Sajudin from the exclusivity clause that had accompanied his $30,000 payment, freeing him to tell his story to whomever he wanted.” Two A.M.I. employees told me that they’d never seen such a release during their time at the company. A.M.I. has said that Karen McDougal, the former ", " model, has a similar amendment to her contract, but McDougal argues that the company continues to try to prevent her from talking to the press.", "Early Thursday morning, shortly after the Radar Online piece, the A.P. ran ", " describing the payment to Sajudin and the legal obstacles it encountered. “During AP’s reporting, AMI threatened legal action over reporters’ efforts to interview current and former employees and hired the New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which challenged the accuracy of the AP’s reporting,” the story said.", "On the surface, it seems surprising that A.M.I. would pay a substantial sum of money for an unverified story. The ", " circulation numbers suggest that the payouts to Sajudin and McDougal came at a time of declining circulation for the publication. Two A.M.I. sources said they believed that the catch-and-kill operations had cemented a partnership between Pecker and Trump, and that people close to the President had subsequently introduced Pecker to potential sources of funding for A.M.I. One A.M.I. source told me, “Pecker’s not going to take thirty thousand dollars from company funds to shut down a potentially damaging story about his buddy without making sure it got back to him so he could get credit.” In 2017, the company began acquiring new publications, including ", " and ", ". According to the ", ", last July Pecker visited the Oval Office and dined at the White House with a French businessman known for brokering deals with Saudi Arabia. Two months later, the businessman and Pecker met with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.", "McDougal is now suing A.M.I. Her complaint states that she was not aware that A.M.I. consulted with Cohen during her negotiations with the company, as was later reported by the ", ", and argues that A.M.I. was attempting to “illegally influence", " the 2016 presidential election.” (A.M.I.’s lawyers, in a response, argued that the company’s actions were protected by the First Amendment and that it was being unfairly penalized for its editorial decision not to run a story.) ", " for defamation and for a release from her nondisclosure agreement. Her suit alleges that Cohen’s payment was a violation of campaign-finance law, because it suppressed speech “on a matter of public concern about a candidate for President.” (Cohen has said that Clifford’s story is false and that he made the payment with his own money to protect Trump and his family. Trump has said that he did not know of the payment.)", "A nonprofit watchdog organization and a left-leaning political group have filed ", " requesting that the Justice Department, the Office of Government Ethics, and the Federal Election Commission examine whether the payments to Clifford and McDougal violated federal election law, since Trump did not include them on his financial-disclosure forms. Federal election law bars individuals from making contributions of more than five thousand four hundred dollars to a candidate during an election cycle.", "Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, said of the payment to Sajudin, “As with the payment to Stormy Daniels and the McDougal matter, there’s certainly enough smoke here to merit further investigation. However, there are questions of both fact and law that would be relevant before concluding that there’s a likely campaign-finance violation.” One question would be whether the intent was to help the campaign. The timing, months after Trump announced his Presidential candidacy, could be “good circumstantial evidence” of that. Hasen added that the cases involving A.M.I. raised difficult legal questions, because media companies have various exemptions from campaign-finance law. However, he said, “If a corporation that has a press function is being used for non-press purposes to help a candidate win an election, then the press exemption would not apply to that activity.”", "Stephen Braga, a white-collar-criminal-defense professor at the University of Virginia’s law school, told me that the payment had potential ramifications for ongoing criminal probes of Trump, particularly given the claims of Cohen’s involvement. “Now with this third event it looks more and more like there’s a pattern developing. That may be one of the things that the F.B.I. was trying to find evidence of with the search warrant,” he said. “The pattern seems to be ‘We use third-party intermediaries to pay off individuals with adverse information that may harm the President.’ That is just a shade away from what the special counsel will be looking for in terms of intent on the obstruction-of-justice investigation.”", "In 2011, a federal grand jury in North Carolina ", " the former Democratic Presidential candidate John Edwards for violating campaign-finance laws by “secretly obtaining and using” nearly a million dollars of political donations to conceal his mistress and their baby while he was running for President in the 2008 election. Edwards denied that the payments violated federal election law. A jury acquitted Edwards on one of the charges brought against him and deadlocked on the rest.

She has lived in the United States, without papers, for the past eighteen years, and during that time she hasn’t voted in a single election. In the U.S., she is not allowed to vote. In Mexico, she is—the country began allowing its citizens who live abroad to vote in 2006—but to register she needed to return home to fill out paperwork. Making the trip would have been too risky, given her legal status, and, until recently, she didn’t feel her vote mattered, anyway.  “I never had any interest—in Mexico, there was no democracy to vote in,” she told me. In the late nineteen-nineties, before she left for the United States, her brother was killed by members of a drug cartel, and she and her family suspected that local officials were involved in his murder. “All the politicians in Mexico were the same,” she said. “What was the point of voting for any of them?”", "Close to twelve million Mexicans, or about ten per cent of Mexico’s over-all population, reside in the U.S. The remittances these expats send home are among Mexico’s largest sources of foreign revenue. Last year, the money totalled nearly twenty-nine billion dollars, which was nine billion dollars more than what Mexico made off its crude-oil exports. Yet, despite their outsized economic contributions, Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. have comparatively little electoral clout in Mexico. Politicians campaigning for national office mostly ignore them. In 2012, the last time Mexico held a Presidential election, only about thirty thousand Mexicans living in the U.S. voted. “There are thirty-one states in Mexico. We’re like another state. We’re a major power, but we aren’t treated like one,” Carolina said.", "This year, Mexico began allowing its citizens living abroad to register to vote without returning to the country. The change comes in the lead-up to what is expected to be a dramatic Presidential election, in July. The current President, Enrique Peña Nieto, is wildly unpopular, owing to a long list of accumulating scandals, ranging from rampant state corruption and abuse of power to escalating criminal violence. Peña Nieto’s reluctance to criticize Donald Trump has further dimmed his party’s election prospects. (Peña Nieto is ineligible to run for reëlection.) A leftist populist named Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador, who is campaigning against the wizened political establishment in Mexico City, has surged ahead in the polls, promising to fight systemic corruption and to stand up to Trump. Last spring, Lopéz Obrador visited eight American cities, including Los Angeles and New York, as part of a national tour to decry Trump’s “", ".” Carolina, who affectionately refers to Lopéz Obrador as “", ",” has registered to vote so that she can cast a ballot for him—and she’s joined a broader effort to persuade other Mexicans in the U.S. to register, too.", "A few weeks ago, before the March 31st deadline for Mexicans to register to vote for the Presidential election, I met Carolina at a banquet hall in St. Peter’s Church, on Lexington Avenue, in Manhattan. She was serving homemade food and selling T-shirts at an event to raise awareness about the importance of voting. A contingent of volunteers from the Lopéz Obrador campaign milled around in beige vests emblazoned with the name of his party, Morena, while dozens of families sat down to have lunch after Sunday services.", "“You see the people here?” Carolina asked. “They’re ", "—agricultural workers. But there’s no work for them at home. They’re here in the U.S. because Mexico has forced them out.” In the weeks preceding our meeting, between shifts at work, she’d been travelling to churches in New York and New Jersey to encourage congregants there to vote. She also plugs Lopéz Obrador. “He’s the only one who isn’t corrupt,” she tells people. “His parents were poor, so he worked and studied. He knows what sacrifice is.”", "Carolina told me the story of how she became politically active. Various YouTube channels had allowed her to follow daily events in Mexico more closely than she had before, and social media made it easier to communicate with family and friends back home. Often, she was appalled by what she learned. The situation she faced in the U.S. reinforced her sense of urgency. “People are scared and upset by Trump,” she said. “He has woken up the Mexicans. He’s making clear to us that the Americans don’t like us. And if Mexico weren’t so bad—so corrupt, so unstable—we could go back. Which is why we need to have more say over who’s in charge there.”", "Juan Carlos Ruiz, an influential local priest and a co-founder of the New York branch of an advocacy group called the New Sanctuary Movement, told me, “Now, because of Trump, immigrants in the U.S. are asking more than ever, ‘If I do have to go back to Mexico, what would I be going back to?’ ” Even if they don’t vote themselves, Mexicans living in the U.S. can still sway family members back home. “There are two sides of the voting issue,” David Brooks, the U.S. correspondent for the Mexican newspaper ", ", told me. “There’s the formal vote, but also the informal vote. The immigrants in the U.S. have a massive influence over how their families vote in Mexico. Because all the money is coming from the", " U.S., the opinion of the people here tends to matter.” More than a hundred thousand Mexican voters in the U.S. were registered by the deadline. That’s a small fraction of the millions of eligible voters in the country, but it’s more than twice the number who registered for Mexico’s last Presidential election. And, in 2006, when Lopéz Obrador also ran for President, he lost by a total of two hundred and forty thousand votes. “People do seem more engaged than they used to,” Ruiz said.  “The circumstances, both in the U.S. and Mexico, have gotten more dire.”", "Peña Nieto’s party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or ", ", has dominated Mexican politics for much of the past century, and it has always viewed expatriate voters with suspicion—not without reason.

These voters fit three general profiles, he said.

The ", " tended to alienate each of these groups, either because of its perceived corruption or because of its sense of disconnect from the Mexican immigrant community abroad. “I would be surprised if this year the majority of Mexican voters abroad don’t vote for ", ",” Sarukhán told me.", "At the church event, a pad and pen circulated from table to table so attendees could sign up for more information about how to register. “There are still big administrative hurdles to signing up,” Roberto Valdovinos, who leads a small nonprofit called Migrante Vota, told me. Requesting voter-registration paperwork is often a cumbersome process: Carolina called a government office in Mexico for information about the documents she needed to present for her registration at the consulate, in Manhattan. It took about two months for a voting credential to arrive in the mail, and then she had to call a toll-free number to activate it. Some Latin American countries allow their citizens abroad to elect their own legislators to represent the expat community in national congresses; other countries set up polling places abroad. Mexico does neither. “My husband is Colombian, and he can vote at the consulate,” Carolina told me. “But not us. We have to mail our ballots back to Mexico. If you’re Mexican, you have to really want to vote.”"]},

He is two decades younger than John Boehner, his predecessor as Speaker of the House; three decades younger than Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the opposition caucus; and a decade younger than Barack Obama, his ideological foil. Ryan’s politics and his persona, which is somehow both abstemious and dreamy, never actually won over large numbers of young people. But in his rise over the past ten years, in his efforts to order the angry chaos of the Tea Party movement into something like a regular political coalition, he always gave the impression of having the benefit of time. Washington would be his, it seemed, long after Obama and Boehner and Pelosi and the rest had left town.", "No longer. On Wednesday morning, Ryan announced that he will not run for reëlection in Wisconsin’s First District, and that he will resign as Speaker of the House. Ryan is forty-eight years old now, still youthful in bearing but no longer a prodigy. At his press conference in the Capitol, all the familiar elements were in place: the chirpy, caffeinated demeanor of the widow’s peak, the assuredness. The reasons he gave for his retirement were personal. His children, he said, were all teen-agers now, and his own father had died when he was sixteen. He did not want to be a “weekend” dad. “You do not last forever” in power in Washington, Ryan said. “It’s fleeting.” He was speaking of his own career. He might also have been speaking about his movement.", "The Tea Party has been a major force in American politics for nearly a decade now, stretching back to the victories that it brought Republicans in the midterm elections in 2010. Ryan did not create the movement, but he did more than any other sitting politician in Washington to welcome it into the Republican fold, to insist that it shared with the G.O.P. establishment an ideological core: that its fury was just atmosphere, and that at its essence was the same stringent set of beliefs—about small government and low taxes—that Ryan himself had grown powerful professing. When the acrimony between the upstarts and the old guard split the House caucus and deposed Boehner, Ryan was the one figure who could repair the breach—who could look at the Tea Party and see his own image—and so he became Speaker of the House. With the rise of Donald Trump, he tried to repeat this maneuver. The new President was bestowed a chief of staff (Reince Priebus) and a press secretary (Sean Spicer) selected from the ranks of Ryan’s Wisconsin allies. And Ryan began insisting to the public that this new regime was headed not toward serial, incandescent feuds but toward tax reform, Obamacare repeal, and entitlement reform—that the order was regular, that the Republican Party was not materially changed.", "Ryan was wrong. The idea that Ryan so often advertised during the 2012 Presidential campaign (when he was the Vice-Presidential nominee)—that the free market is an anti-poverty program—has disappeared from his party, and been replaced by the instinct to punch down. The deficits he said that he was in Washington to limit have, under his watch, ballooned. In the capitols of Republican-controlled states, where the Party’s scorched-earth partisanship has found its most extreme expression, the project is faltering, with a wave of special-election reversals and, more recently, mass teacher strikes. The ease with which Trump claimed the Party (recent polls have put the President’s approval rating among Republicans at almost thirty points higher than Ryan’s) showed how badly Ryan had misjudged things; it now seems clear that the Tea Party was an expressive movement, not an ideological one. In November, we will learn whether the whole era of small-government Republican partisanship that coalesced in the Tea Party will fade with Ryan, too.", "The country will be better off now that Ryan has less influence. The major accomplishment he claimed on Wednesday morning was the tax bill that he and his colleagues passed last year, a piece of legislation loaded with giveaways to corporations and the wealthy, and which will only escalate the country’s profound inequalities. Whether his party will be better without him is not as clear. In Washington, insiders believe the next Speaker will be either the transactional House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, of California, or the more stringent conservative Whip, Steve Scalise, of Louisiana, who last year was shot in an assassination attempt at a congressional baseball practice. Ryan was adept at finding euphemisms for his party’s aims, even as many members of his caucus devoted themselves to making a cult of victimized white men. They now find themselves under pressure—facing protests and electoral challenges—from coalitions organized largely by high-achieving women.", "At his press conference, Ryan hedged a bit about the nature of his departure. He promised that he would “keep fighting” for entitlement reform, though he did not specify in what capacity. He suggested that he had “more thoughts” on who should replace him but said that this was not the time to share them. He emphasized that his kids are all teen-agers, and that he wanted to be at home with them, but of course adolescence is a temporary condition. For now, the soon-to-be-ex-Speaker is headed back to Wisconsin, a good place to ride out a wave: just after Ryan announced his retirement, election analysts at", " the University of Virginia and ", " suggested that his safe congressional seat was now a tossup. Ryan is not yet fifty; he might be imagining a Presidential run in two years’ time, or six. But politics is changing quickly right now. He may not have a recognizable party to return to."]},

Instead of seeing Zuckerberg ask for forgiveness, we saw the opportunism of elected officials who wanted something from Zuckerberg. Republicans and Democrats lined up to rattle their cups. Representative Greg Walden, the committee’s Republican chairman, noted with pride that Zuckerberg had chosen to put one of Facebook’s huge data centers in Prineville, Oregon—in Walden’s district. Eliot Engel, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and part of Westchester County, in New York, name-checked Zuckerberg’s high school and wondered aloud whether he “might commit to returning to Westchester County.”", "Joe Barton, the committee’s vice-chairman, openly praised Zuckerberg for having hired James Barnette, the committee’s former counsel, as a lobbyist. “If he’s affiliated with Facebook, you’ve got a good one,” Barton said. “If he’s not, he’s just got a great seat.” The room broke out in laughter. Everyone knew why Barnette, who was seated immediately behind Zuckerberg, was there. His presence was an open demonstration of Facebook’s willingness to do business with Commerce and Energy’s friends and family. Two hundred thousand dollars of the eleven and a half million that ", " on lobbying last year went to Barnette’s law firm, Steptoe & Johnson.", "Representative Morgan Griffith asked Zuckerberg if Facebook could help his district, in southwestern Virginia, get broadband Internet connections. “Can you also agree—yes or no—to update me?” Griffith said, as though asking for future contact were a hardball question.  “Yes, Congressman,” Zuckerberg answered, displaying a rare smile. “We will certainly follow up with you on this.” He had promised something similar to Senator Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia, on Tuesday, when he appeared before two Senate committees. There was a time, in living memory, when rural America could look to the federal government to look after its needs. Today West Virginia’s best chance for fast internet may be a conscience-stricken tech billionaire seeking to buy himself an indulgence.", "There were some more aggressive lines of questioning, too. A Republican congressman wanted to know about Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump commentators who ", " received a message from Facebook telling them that their videos were “unsafe to the community.” Zuckerberg called this incident an “enforcement error”—some kind of human mistake in the system. There was a moment of real anger from Representative David McKinley, of West Virginia, who questioned Zuckerberg about Facebook’s role in the robust online market for illegal opioids. “You are hurting people,” McKinley said. “I agree that this is a terrible issue,” Zuckerberg replied. “Respectfully, when there are tens of billions or one hundred billion pieces of content that are shared every day, even twenty thousand people reviewing it can’t look at everything.” He suggested that stopping the sale of illegal drugs wasn’t his problem; it was up to individual users to flag the ads.", "On questions concerning privacy, the manipulation of elections, and the tens of millions of Americans who had their Facebook data surreptitiously obtained by ", ", Zuckerberg stuck to the answers he had established during his Senate hearing on Tuesday. Facebook was sorry. Facebook was investigating what had happened. Facebook wasn’t necessarily opposed to ", ", but “the details matter.”", "Will all this result in Congress actually taking actions that affect Facebook? Even a small regulatory move could do a lot of damage to Facebook’s bottom line. According to Facebook’s own annual reports, North American users are worth a hundred dollars a head each year, about three times as much as users in Europe, which has a much stricter regulatory regime. That tremendous stream of revenue can buy a lot of clout in Washington. ", ", Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana, summed things up pretty well. “There are going to be a whole bunch of bills introduced to regulate Facebook,” he told Zuckerberg. “It’s up to you whether they pass or not.”", "Kennedy was articulating something that is an open secret in Washington: that members of Congress will have very little say in how the emerging law around privacy and technology will be written. It will be mostly up to Zuckerberg and his peers in the tech industry. Zuckerberg could, Kennedy said, “spend ten million dollars on lobbyists and fight us,” or he could try actually to do something about data breaches, foreign propaganda, and all the other problems that have taken root on his platform. The hearings themselves, with Zuckerberg going through the motions of submitting himself to public scrutiny, were little more than ceremony. As long as the tech industry is willing to throw its money around to get what it wants, few on the Hill will dare take it on.", "At the same time, there were a few members of Congress who were willing to speak up for Facebook’s users. On Wednesday, Representative Bobby Rush, of Illinois, an Army veteran and former Black Panther who was active in the civil-rights movement, compared Facebook to ", ", the domestic-surveillance program that the F.B.I. conducted, in the nineteen-sixties. Zuckerberg pushed back. Government surveillance, he said, does not “give people the option to delete the data they have.”", "I found Rush in the hall during a recess on Wednesday. “Facebook has to protect  the rights of Americans,” he said. “Facebook is gathering information about their habits, their", " hates, their joys, their plans, their pain, their future—the most basic, intimate information. Facebook has an absolute responsibility to protect that information. Zuckerberg is doing what he intended to do. He is attempting to put a pleasant face over some atrocious abuses that Facebook has been allowing to occur. This threatens our form of government if it is not stopped immediately. We could quickly move to a totalitarian type of government. And the American people are not even noticing these affronts of their right to privacy.”", "During the hearing, Representative Jan Schakowsky, also of Illinois, read off some of Zuckerberg’s past apologies—the many times, through the years that he has asked for forgiveness from his users for misunderstandings, scandals, or breaches of trust. How long would the internal investigation into possible data breaches by Facebook’s third-party apps take? she asked.", "“Many months,” Zuckerberg said.", "“Years?” Schakowsky asked.", "“I hope not,” Zuckerberg answered.", "Schakowsky was not happy with the vagueness of this timeline. “It could be years!” she exclaimed to me, a few minutes later, during a recess. Unlike some of her colleagues, she was not content to leave regulatory matters in Facebook’s hands. “I think the American people—who love their technology, I get it—believe that there ought to be some safeguards,” she said. “He blames the consumer. You didn’t read the terms of service. You pressed ‘I agree.’ Sorry. That’s just not good enough.”"]},

But, mostly, Lowe said, “they’re paranoid about the performance of their own team. Even during successful years, there’s a looming fear that it is all going to come crashing down.”", "Andrew Barkley, who just turned thirty, has watched the Raptors since he was in the sixth grade. A while back, he started to occasionally mute Raptors games on television when things started to go badly on the court. Three years ago, after the Washington Wizards swept the Raptors in the first round of the playoffs, he began watching entire games on mute. Paul Pierce, a forward then playing for the Wizards, “really got under my skin,” he said. As the team has improved, the playoffs have become the real source of concern for fans like Barkley. In each of the past four postseasons, the Raptors have lost Game 1 of the first round, each time at home; they have been swept out of the playoffs twice. Their star players, Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, have shot below their career percentages in many of these games; to watch a Raptors playoff game has often felt like watching one side lose more slowly than the other.

Sean Craig, who grew up in Texas but who recently spent several years in Toronto for work, told me that “Raptors fans are, unfortunately, emotionally destructive lunatics who tear themselves into pieces.” When he lived in Toronto, Craig watched his friends go through an annual cycle of pessimism, anxiety, and sadness when the playoffs rolled around. “That’s unfortunate,” he added, “because they’re also some of the best fans in the world.”", "The team’s best fan, or at least its biggest, might be Nav Bhatia, the owner of two Hyundai dealerships in Toronto, who can be seen seated courtside at every Raptors home game—and who frequently travels to watch the team on the road.

But that fiery rhetoric—more theatrical than substantive—may be the limit of Russia’s immediate reaction, or at least a signifier that its response will not be on the battlefield.", "The ", " struck by the United States, United Kingdom, and France, were not targets of particular significance to Russian military operations in Syria or locations that housed Russian troops or equipment. In fact, it seems that Russia had some idea of what to expect ahead of time.

However, a ", " on Saturday morning said that French military officials had in fact warned their Russian counterparts of the impending strikes.

Those words contained the rather provocative suggestion that Russia would fire on U.S. warships and airplanes. Other Russian officials were more muted than Gerasimov, saying Russia would act only if its forces sustained a direct hit; then, last week, Russia’s Ambassador to Lebanon said that any and all American missiles would be shot down, and their launch sites targeted.", "That whipped up fears of a direct U.S.-Russian military confrontation, which, given the personalities of the countries’ two leaders and the sizable nuclear arsenals at their disposal, was cause for discomfort. But those fears also have tactical utility for the Kremlin, both in terms of causing alarm in Western capitals and serving to unite the population at home against the spectre of foreign aggression.

In any case, the announcement seems to be code for nothing-to-see-here.", "One unresolved question is whether Russia, in an implicit understanding with Washington and other governments—as a condition of a more limited Western response—got assurances from Syria that it would refrain from using chemical weapons in the future. Those would be hollow promises in any case, given that Russia was the supposed guarantor of the deal, initiated in 2013, that was supposed to insure that all of Syria’s chemical stockpiles were removed from the country. It’s also unclear how much operational control the Kremlin really wields over Assad. It’s advantageous for Russia to act as if its role is significant, but the truth may be more complicated. Regardless, it certainly wants to retain the image of holding decisive influence over Assad—that, along with its airbase in Khmeimim, are the most useful chips it has in the Syrian conflict.", "That makes Russia conflicted as Assad seeks to retake the last pockets of rebel-held territory in his country, in part by using horrific, indiscriminate violence, including chemical weapons. Moscow welcomes Assad’s defeat of the rebels, and has little concern for how he achieves it, but the use of chemical weapons is an embarrassment and source of unwelcome consequences for the Kremlin. The latest air strikes do nothing to change the battlefield dynamics in Syria or the course of the war—which is to say, a U.S.-Russian showdown over Syria has most likely been delayed rather than avoided entirely.", "For now, the immediate theatre for U.S.-Russian confrontation will likely shift to sanctions. On April 6th, the Trump Administration released", " a new round of sanctions, directed at a broader list of Russian individuals and companies. They had an immediate effect on those listed (Oleg Deripaska, a metals tycoon, saw his personal net worth drop by more than a billion dollars), and on the Russian economy as a whole (the Russian stock market and value of the ruble fell by the sharpest amounts since 2014, in the wake of sanctions over Crimea). By sanctioning Rusal, Russia’s largest aluminum producer, with a majority share held by Deripaska, the White House effectively levied a trade embargo on a significant Russian export.", "Russia is now discussing a range of countersanctions, though its options are limited: the United States has many more tools to disrupt Russia’s economy than vice versa. That means the Kremlin often ends up inflicting costs on the Russian population when formulating sanctions against the West. Banning the import of U.S.-made pharmaceuticals or coöperation on space and civilian nuclear programs might cause a blip of discomfort in the United States, but a whole lot more than that in Russia itself. What’s clear is that relations between the two countries haven’t yet hit bottom, and the restraint—whether strategically wise or not—shown this weekend may not hold."]},

Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s President, gambled that he could use chemical weapons to seal a victory in an offensive just outside his country’s capital, and that he and his regime could survive whatever the world would do in response. And he was right.", "Any civilized person should feel some satisfaction knowing that a leader as murderous as Assad is being punished for his crimes. If you harbor any doubts about Assad’s villainy, take a minute to watch one of the ", " of the scene last Saturday in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, after it came under chemical attack. Assertions about who perpetrated the attack, by both Syrian rebels and American officials, are convincing: the chemical weapons, possibly a nerve agent such as VX or sarin, were delivered in large canisters that also contained chlorine gas—those canisters appear to be far too large to have been delivered by anything but an airplane or helicopter, the kind of hardware which no rebel group is known to possess. If you’re still skeptical, I release you to the realm of conspiracy theory.", "There has been plenty of speculation, too, about President Trump’s motivations in attacking Syria, but what matters here are the results. Assad deserves whatever he gets, and if the strikes ordered by President Trump have the effect of deterring even one other chemical-weapons attack, then we should all be glad.", "The trouble is, Assad deserves much worse, and he’s not going to get it—not from the United States, nor from the West more generally. American forces could have inflicted much greater damage—Trump could have ordered the killing of Assad and everyone around him if he had wanted to. I’m confident that neither Trump nor any of his senior military advisers have any love for Assad. But, in testimony last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis ", " he was worried that American military action in Syria, if it went too far, could start a wider war, principally with Assad’s chief patron, Russia.", "Earlier this week, after Trump tweeted his intention to strike Syria, Assad began parking his warplanes on Russian bases, no doubt because he wagered that Trump would refrain from striking them there. It’s not that Putin has any special feelings for Assad. But having moved into the Middle East power vacuum created by American inaction in Syria, Putin will fight tenaciously to preserve his new foothold in the region. In February, American and Russian forces became entangled—the Russians ", " that round—but it seems clear that American commanders don’t want to do anything in Syria that would provoke Putin.", "There’s another dynamic at work here, too. The Americans clearly don’t want to do anything that could prompt Assad’s sudden downfall, either. The fear, in the White House and among military commanders, is that a sudden collapse of Assad’s regime would open a vacuum in the country and that it would be filled, Baghdad-style, by chaos or, worse, by jihadis, who would probably embark on a massacre of the Alawite minority to which Assad belongs. What would the United States do then?", "Assad knows this, of course. His strategy has been clear: let the Americans and other Western countries focus on destroying ", ", his main enemy, and don’t make the outside world too angry. All of his escalations have been calculated and gradual, even his use of chemical weapons. In the present case, Assad’s forces were moving into a rebel-held area called Douma, just outside Damascus. (Douma is located in Eastern Ghouta, the site of a horrific chemical-weapons attack in 2013. That attack prompted President Barack Obama to strike a deal with Assad to surrender all of his chemical weapons. That agreement now looks like an American humiliation.)", "Assad’s position has been strengthened greatly by the American-led destruction of ", "—he ought to thank Trump for that—and lately he’s been trying to consolidate the long strip of cities and towns he holds between the Mediterranean, Aleppo, and Damascus. Eastern Ghouta—and Douma more specifically—represents one of the last rebel-held areas around the capital. Douma used to be home to about four hundred thousand people; when Assad’s latest offensive began, its population had fallen to about a quarter of that. Still, Assad’s ground forces, even with the assistance of Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards, are extremely depleted, and they could have anticipated a very hard fight in Douma. “It would have been a meat grinder,’’ Jennifer Cafarella, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, in Washington, said.", "That’s where the chemical weapons come in. They’re lethal and efficient. And they did what they were intended to do. The offensive against Douma is proceeding, with Assad offering the rebels and residents there a choice of evacuation by bus, or probably death or imprisonment if they stay. It’s not a pretty picture.", "The wider point is that the latest missile strikes may deter Assad from using chemical weapons again for a while. And that’s good. But this action is not likely to alter the course of the war or even, most likely, Assad’s calculations about using such weapons again. After all, they’ve worked before."]},

It was the Evolution Championship Series, known as Evo, an annual fighting-game tournament and one of the largest e-sports competitions in the world. It was held in the convention hall at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in Las Vegas; an arena had been set up, with a ring in the center, as for a boxing match, but the lights were dimmed and a giant screen hung from the ceiling. The champion fighting-game player Hajime Taniguchi, who goes by Tokido, took out a tape measure before every match so to insure that the distance between his face and his monitor never changed. Jeffries spent a decade in the N.B.A., playing for the Washington Wizards, New York Knicks, Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers, and the atmosphere at Evo reminded him of a playoff game. Watching Tokido, he thought of the obsessive-compulsive rituals he’d seen among fellow basketball players, such as the routines players perform before shooting free throws.", "Just days before, Jeffries had left a promising front-office position in the N.B.A. to become president of the e-sports organization Echo Fox. Jeffries grew up in basketball-loving Indiana—in 2000, he was named Mr. Basketball, an honor given to Indiana’s top high-school player. He got a scholarship to Indiana University, and in 2002 he was drafted by the Wizards. After he retired, in 2013, he became a scout for the Denver Nuggets. In 2016, the team promoted him to director of pro personnel. Then, last spring, Jeffries had a conversation with the venture capitalist Stratton Sclavos, the former co-owner of the San Jose Sharks, of the National Hockey League. Jeffries met Sclavos a few years ago, through mutual friends. Their talk turned to Jeffries’s career. During his time in the N.B.A., Jeffries had grown accustomed to moving from city to city, and he mentioned to Sclavos that he’d been thinking about making another professional change. “Can you come to L.A.?” Sclavos asked. He had an idea.", "Sclavos had recently invested in Echo Fox, which is co-owned by Rick Fox, another former N.B.A. player. Echo Fox fields e-sports teams in eleven different games—it’s as if the Mets, Jets, Nets, Islanders, Liberty, and New York Red Bulls were owned and operated by a single entity. The video-game competition industry has exploded in recent years: a ", " in January from Morgan Stanley predicted that e-sports will be worth about $1.5 billion by 2020. This week, ", ", an e-sports league owned in part by the N.B.A. itself, held its first-ever draft, at Madison Square Garden. Sclavos wanted Echo Fox to be run in the same fashion as the most sophisticated professional sports franchises, and he believed that Jeffries’s experiences both as an athlete and an executive could help make that happen.", "Jeffries was familiar with e-sports; while playing for the Knicks, he and his teammates Quentin Richardson, Malik Rose, and Eddy Curry would spend their free time playing World of Warcraft, a popular multiplayer fantasy game. But, as he told me recently, over lunch in midtown Manhattan, he didn’t know much about the business side of things. So, he began studying. He watched the video of a panel from the M.I.T. Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. He spoke to a former Major League Baseball owner who had invested in the industry. And he consulted friends of his from around the N.B.A. Some of them were less enthusiastic than others. Calvin Booth, a former teammate on the Wizards, “said I was an idiot,” Jeffries said. But he was excited about the unknown. “In e-sports, there is no model, you’re creating your own template for everything,” he said. He now oversees eleven teams and nearly fifty athletes—a label that Jeffries believes ", ", “because of the dedication and talent it takes to play, and the required reaction time.”", "Jake Fyfe, the general manager of Echo Fox’s League of Legends team, told me that he was skeptical at first that a basketball player, and an e-sports novice, could help. But then he and Jeffries started meeting regularly. Jeffries explained how, when he was with the Nuggets, he and his colleagues would pitch ownership on potential personnel additions by compiling pages of data—ages, family background, strengths, weaknesses. The approach served two purposes: it helped convince bosses to approve decisions, and, when a decision backfired, the information could be cued up as proof of process. “He showed me what it looks like to be running the front office of an N.B.A. team,” Fyfe said.", "Before Jeffries arrived, most of Echo Fox’s gamers roomed with their teammates in company-owned houses. Jeffries began encouraging Echo Fox athletes to move out of those homes and instead live on their own. “I know, when I was a player, I wouldn’t have wanted to be playing with my teammates for twelve hours and then go home and spend another twelve hours with them,” he told Fyfe. Many Echo Fox players for the League of Legends team are Korean; Jeffries requested that the organization hire an assistant manager who could also serve as a Korean translator, and he hired a Korean chef to help the players feel more at home.", "When I met Jeffries for lunch, he was carrying a briefcase full of laminated binders with pages of photos and statistics: “kill-to-death ratio,”", " “assist rate,” and “map awareness.” Those particular stats are publicly available; others listed in the binder were proprietary. Jeffries was using all of the data to search for a new gamer who could replace an Echo Fox athlete who had recently enlisted in the military. Did Jeffries understand what all the numbers meant? “Most,” he said. “But I’m smart enough to know when I’m not smart at something”—a line he would repeat more than once.", "After every season, League of Legends teams are given an opportunity to reshape their rosters by signing players not under contract with other teams. That free-agency period begins in November, but Jeffries began meeting with Fyfe to discuss it in August. Echo Fox’s League of Legends team had failed to reach the playoffs in each of the last four seasons, and so, for three months, Jeffries and Fyfe convened every day in a conference room at the franchise’s spacious Beverly Hills office. Spreadsheets blanketed the table. They scribbled strategies on white boards. They watched tape and combed through statistics and ran roster simulations. Sometimes Fyfe would call up friends from other teams to try to learn if they were planning on keeping certain players. Ultimately, Echo Fox replaced their entire starting roster, signing five new League of Legends players, and hired a new coach. The team made it to the playoffs. On Saturday, they’ll square off against Clutch Gaming in a fight for third place."]},

I went to a gate on the side of the Republican Palace, in the Green Zone, where an American soldier was receiving, one by one, a long line of Iraqis who came with questions and complaints. I remember a man complaining that his house had been run over by a tank. There was a woman who had been a government employee and wanted to know about her salary. The soldier had a form he was supposed to fill out with each person’s request and that person’s contact information. I stood there as the man talked to each person and, each time, said, “Phone number?” And each person would answer some version of “The phone system of Iraq has been destroyed and doesn’t work.” Then the soldier would turn to the next person, write down the person’s question or complaint, and then ask, “Phone number?”", "I arrived in Baghdad on April 12th of that year, a few days after Saddam’s statue at Firdos Square had been destroyed. There were a couple of weeks of uncertainty as reporters and Iraqis tried to gauge who was in charge of the country and what the general plan was. There was no electricity, no police, no phones, no courts, no schools. More than half of Iraqis worked for the government, and there ", " no government, no Army, and so no salaries for most of the country. At first, it seemed possible that the Americans simply needed a bit of time to communicate the new rules. By the end of April, though, it was clear: there was no plan, no new order. Iraq was anarchic.", "We journalists were able to use generators and satellite dishes to access outside information, and what we saw was absurd. Americans seemed convinced things were going well in Iraq. The war—and the President who launched it—were seen favorably by seventy per cent of Americans. Then came these pictures of a President touting “Mission Accomplished”—the choice of words that President Trump used ", " on Saturday, the morning after he ordered an air strike on Syria. On the ground, we were not prophets or political geniuses. We were sentient adults who were able to see the clear, obvious truth in front of us. The path of Iraq would be decided by those who thrived in chaos.", "I had a similar feeling in December, 2007. I came late to the financial crisis. I had spent much of 2006 and 2007 naïvely swatting away warnings from my friends and sources who told me of impending disaster. Finally, I decided to take a deep look at collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.s, those financial instruments that would soon be known as toxic assets. I read technical books, talked to countless experts, and soon learned that these were, in Warren Buffett’s famous phrase, weapons of financial mass destruction. They were engineered in such a way that they could exponentially increase profits but would, also, exponentially increase losses. Worse, they were too complex to be fully understood. It was impossible, even with all the information, to figure out what they were worth once they began to fail. Because these C.D.O.s had come to form the core value of most major banks’ assets, no major bank had clear value. With that understanding, the path was clear. Eventually, people would realize that the essential structure of our financial system was about to implode. Yet many political figures and TV pundits were happily touting the end of a crisis.

The path of both crises turned out to be far worse than I had imagined.", "I thought of those earlier experiences this week as I began to feel a familiar clarity about what will unfold next in the Trump Presidency. There are lots of details and surprises to come, but the endgame of this Presidency seems as clear now as those of Iraq and the financial crisis did months before they unfolded. Last week, federal investigators ", ", the man who has been closer than anybody to Trump’s most problematic business and personal relationships. This week, we learned that Cohen has been under criminal investigation for months—his e-mails have been read, presumably his phones have been tapped, and his meetings have been monitored. Trump has long declared a red line: Robert Mueller must not investigate his businesses, and must only look at any possible collusion with Russia. That red line is now crossed and, for Trump, in the most troubling of ways. Even if he were to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and then have Mueller and his investigation put on ice, and even if—as is disturbingly possible—Congress did nothing, the Cohen prosecution would continue. Even if Trump pardons Cohen, the information the Feds have on him can become the basis for charges against others in the Trump Organization.", "This is the week we know, with increasing certainty, that we are entering the last", " phase of the Trump Presidency. This doesn’t feel like a prophecy; it feels like a simple statement of the apparent truth. I know dozens of reporters and other investigators who have studied Donald Trump and his business and political ties. Some have been skeptical of the idea that President Trump himself knowingly colluded with Russian officials. It seems not at all Trumpian to participate in a complex plan with a long-term, uncertain payoff. Collusion is an imprecise word, but it does seem close to certain that his son Donald, Jr., and several people who worked for him ", "; it is up to prosecutors and then the courts to figure out if this was illegal or merely deceitful.

In Azerbaijan, he did business with a ", " for Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In the Republic of Georgia, he partnered with a group that was ", " for a possible role in the largest known bank-fraud and money-laundering case in history.

His Taj Mahal casino received what was ", " for money-laundering violations.", "Listing all the financial misconduct can be overwhelming and tedious. I have limited myself to some of the deals over the past decade, thus ignoring Trump’s long history of links to New York Mafia figures and other financial irregularities. It has become commonplace to say that enough was known about Trump’s shady business before he was elected; his followers voted for him precisely because they liked that he was someone willing to do whatever it takes to succeed, and they also believe that all rich businesspeople have to do shady things from time to time. In this way of thinking, any new information about his corrupt past has no political salience. Those who hate Trump already think he’s a crook; those who love him don’t care.", "I believe this assessment is wrong. Sure, many people have a vague sense of Trump’s shadiness, but once the full details are better known and digested, a fundamentally different narrative about Trump will become commonplace. Remember: we knew a lot about problems in Iraq in May, 2003. Americans saw TV footage of looting and heard reports of U.S. forces struggling to gain control of the entire country. We had plenty of reporting, throughout 2007, about various minor financial problems. Somehow, though, these specific details failed to impress upon most Americans the over-all picture. It took a long time for the nation to accept that these were not minor aberrations but, rather, signs of fundamental crisis. Sadly, things had to get much worse before Americans came to see that our occupation of Iraq was disastrous and, a few years later, that our financial system was in tatters.", "The narrative that will become widely understood is that Donald Trump did not sit atop a global empire. He was not an intuitive genius and tough guy who created billions of dollars of wealth through fearlessness.

Even in this, the Trump Organization left money on the table, taking a million dollars here, five million there, even though the service they provided—giving branding legitimacy to blatantly sketchy projects—was worth far more. It was not a company that built value over decades, accumulating assets and leveraging wealth. It burned through whatever good will and brand value it established as quickly as possible, then moved on to the next scheme.", "There are important legal questions that remain. How much did Donald Trump and his children know about the criminality of their partners? How explicit were they in agreeing to put a shiny gold brand on top of corrupt deals? The answers to these questions will play a role in determining whether they go to jail and, if so, for how long.", "There is no longer one major investigation into Donald Trump, focussed solely on collusion with Russia. There are now at least two, including a thorough review of Cohen’s correspondence. The information in his office and hotel room will likely make clear precisely how much the Trump family knew. What we already know is disturbing, and it is hard to imagine that the information prosecutors will soon learn will do anything but worsen the picture.", "Of course Trump is raging and furious and terrified. Prosecutors are now looking at his core. Cohen was the key intermediary between the Trump family and its", " partners around the world; he was chief consigliere and dealmaker throughout its period of expansion into global partnerships with sketchy oligarchs. He wasn’t a slick politico who showed up for a few months. He knows everything, he recorded much of it, and now prosecutors will know it, too. It seems inevitable that much will be made public. We don’t know when. We don’t know the precise path the next few months will take. There will be resistance and denial and counterattacks. But it seems likely that, when we look back on this week, we will see it as a turning point. We are now in the end stages of the Trump Presidency."]},

Republicans tend to wear red ties,” James Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., told George Stephanopoulos in an interview, sections of which were aired on “20/20,” on Sunday night (ABC News posted other clips and a ", "). Comey, whose six-feet-eight-inch frame seemed folded into his chair, didn’t wear any tie for the interview. Stephanopoulos had just asked Comey about how he’d decided what to put on for the press conference on July 5, 2016, when he announced that there would be no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton related to her private e-mail server. “I chose a gold tie that morning, ’cause I didn’t want to wear either of the normal gang colors,” he said.", "The phrase “gang colors” might be an example of what Comey referred to elsewhere in the interview as “gallows humor.” He mentioned the term to describe why he smiled and made a joke when a deputy told him that the decision of whether or not to prosecute Clinton left him “totally screwed”—meaning that neither political party would be happy. But this reaction also reveals something about Comey’s essential, and essentially disdainful, view of politics. His well-earned sense of horror at Donald Trump is only one example of this disdain; a theme of his statements in the interview was that the F.B.I. must be seen as trustworthy at all costs, because there’s not much chance that politicians will be. That is a depressing and, to borrow another of Comey’s words, “dangerous” notion for a democracy. In Trump’s case, however, Comey does not seem to see the “gang” designation as a metaphor. From the moment he met him, during a visit to Trump Tower shortly after the election, Comey had a “flashback,” he told Stephanopoulos, to his days chasing the Mafia as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York.", "“There’s an expression in the Mafia, there’s a distinction between a friend of yours and a friend of ours. A friend of yours is someone on the outside of the family. A friend of ours, an ", " is the way they talked about it in Sicilian, is part of the Family, capital ‘F,’ ” Comey said. He was at Trump Tower, sitting with Trump and members of his circle, to brief them on possible Russian interference in the election. He got the sense that their main priority was not the integrity of the electoral system but how the story might play, and that Trump and his associates were attempting “to make us all ", ". We’re all part of the messaging, we’re all part of the effort. The boss is at the head of the table and we’re going to figure out together how to do this.”", "“How strange is it for you to sit here and compare the President to a mob boss?” Stephanopoulos asked.", "“Very strange,” Comey said, although, at this point, with all we know about the Trump Organization’s way of operating, and with the President’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, the subject of an F.B.I. raid and what appears to be a sprawling investigation covering matters ranging from hush payments to taxi medallions, it seems less strange by the minute. “And I don’t do it lightly,” Comey continued, saying that he was not trying to “suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and, you know, shaking down shopkeepers. But, instead, what I’m talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump Administration.” That experience included what Comey called the “loyalty dinner,” a week after the Inauguration, when Trump, he said, asked for a pledge of fealty; an Oval Office meeting during which Trump said, of a criminal investigation into his former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, “I hope you can let it go”; and other instances of the President saying things that were, in Comey’s view, “just a lie.”", "And the wonders never cease. Trump’s response to Comey’s interview, and to advance reports about his memoir, “", ",” which comes out on Tuesday, has been of a piece with the character portrait that Comey draws. Trump’s Twitter rant began on Friday: “James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired”—by Trump himself, that is. “He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH.” That exhortation is more illustrative of the President’s tendency to call for the prosecution of his perceived political enemies than of anything that Comey has done. Trump continued, writing that Comey was “weak,” an “untruthful slime ball,” and part of a “den of thieves and lowlifes.” There was another level of  “slimeball!” over the weekend, an assertion that “Slippery James Comey” was untruthful and that the memos he said he’d kept on the President’s conversations were “FAKE!” (When Stephanopoulos asked if, in writing those memos, Comey had “shifted to collecting evidence of a possible crime,” Comey replied, “Well, yes, in a sense.”) On Monday morning, Trump tweeted that Comey and others “committed many crimes!”", "At that first Trump Tower meeting, though, Comey did not push the members of the Trump team on their response, because he was about", " to clear the room and brief the President alone on some of the lurid allegations in what has become known as the Steele dossier. These included the possibility that the Russians had a video of Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, to which the President-elect’s first response, as Comey recalled, was to interrupt “very defensively and started talking about it, you know, ‘Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?’ ”", "“I assumed he was asking that rhetorically,” Comey told Stephanopoulos. “I didn’t answer that.” Instead, Comey explained that it was a “defensive briefing.” The whole thing was, he said, “really weird.” Stephanopoulos asked how “graphic” he had been. Comey replied that, at that meeting, he did not get into the unproven allegations, in the document, that the prostitutes had urinated on each other in front of the President. It is an image, it seems, that Comey, as much as he knows that it has not been substantiated, has had trouble banishing from his imagination. At one moment in the interview with Stephanopoulos—one not part of the broadcast—in which Comey was discussing how far his disbelief of Trump extends, he described his internal dismantling of Trump’s argument, made in a call to Comey a week after BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier, that the charge couldn’t possibly be true, because he is a “germophobe” who did not even spend the whole night in the hotel.", "“I remember thinking, ‘Well, should I say that, as I understand the activity, sir, it doesn’t require an overnight stay? And, given that it was allegedly the Presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton, I would imagine you could be at a safe distance from the activity.’ ” He added, “All these things are bouncing around my head. But instead of saying it, it just led me to think, ‘The world’s gone crazy.’ ”", "Comey told Stephanopoulos that his biggest shortcomings are his ego and his sense of his own righteousness, and both were  on display during the interview. Does Comey really think that he should have got into a debate with the President about the exact logistics of a still spurious allegation? It is a moment when Comey himself, in fairness, is being a little strange, too.", "Stephanopoulos spent a good deal of time on one of Comey’s more controversial moments: his decision, less than two weeks before the 2016 election, to reactivate the investigation into Clinton’s e-mail server. The proximate cause was the discovery of hundreds of thousands of State Department e-mails on a laptop used by Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and the husband of one of Clinton’s closest aides, Huma Abedin. Justice Department guidelines call for avoiding taking any action close to Election Day that might affect the outcome of the vote. “And I’m sitting there, on the morning of October 27th, and I can’t see a door that’s labelled, ‘No action here,’ ” Comey told Stephanopoulos. “I can only see two doors, and they’re both actions. One says, ‘Speak,’ the other says, ‘Conceal.’ ” He added, “Speaking is really bad; concealing is catastrophic.” He was, he said, “operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump,” and thus, if that discovery came out after Election Day, “She’ll be an illegitimate President.” And in this alternate world, he said, the F.B.I. and other institutions of justice would “never recover from that.”", "It would be wrong to dismiss Comey’s point of view, but also wrong not to question it. Stephanopoulos asked if Comey might have made more of an effort to find out, first, whether the e-mails were relevant—they were not, as the F.B.I. confirmed in another reversal, issued a few days before the election—and Comey had no real answer, other than to say that he took at face value his subordinates’ notion that there wasn’t enough time to evaluate them first. Could he have directed them to put every possible person on it, to get technical help, to work around the clock? And why were the investigators, who had apparently known something about the e-mails for a few weeks, so slow to bring the problem to him? Comey did not have a good answer to those questions, but he was, again, clear about his priorities: the best thing he could do was to make sure that everybody trusts the F.B.I. But law enforcement cannot, in the long run, be a proxy for democratic accountability.", "It can feel as though we are headed that way, and that is a reason to be cautious about the allure of impeachment, as opposed to the next Presidential election, as a quick fix for the problem of Donald Trump. There is a stage, no longer so hard to imagine, at which impeachment might become necessary, out of simple respect for the Constitution and the rule of law. But Comey himself worries that impeachment would let voters “off the hook.” At the same time, he does not completely shy away from that prospect, calling his own interactions with the President “evidence of obstruction of justice.” He added, “It would depend—and I’m just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor—it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.”", "That note raises another question about both the interview and Comey’s book. Is the book meant to be his act of witness, and, if", " so, to what? Is it meant to make a legal case or to take an ethical stand? He calls Trump “morally unfit,” and he told Stephanopoulos that he wants to be “useful.” But, given that he might be called to testify, if it ever comes to the point of an impeachment trial in the Senate (which would depend on the Democrats winning the House in November), there is some awkwardness in his publishing a book before the investigation of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is complete. Then again, it all might put Trump in such a rage that it proves a catalyst for his firing of Mueller and anyone else in his way. That is not to say that Comey wrote the book with any thought of the consequences, other than with regard to setting the record straight about his own time, as he sees it, in the land of politicians.", "In the extended interview, Stephanopoulos asked Comey about Trump’s complaint that Hillary Clinton was not interviewed about her e-mails “under oath.” Comey reminded him that lying to federal investigators, under oath or not, is a crime. Indeed, he made the point a number of times in their exchange that he believes it is a crime that is particularly important to prosecute, in a nation that has drifted away from the day “when people were afraid of going to hell.” He also said, of the criminality of lying to investigators, that he was sure that President Trump’s lawyers, “given his situation, are focussing him on this.” In other words, they need to remind Trump, in the days to come, not to lie. It may not be so easy."]},

We don’t know for certain the cause; the board and Sorrell agreed to sign, in the words of someone close to the board, “strict N.D.A.s,” meaning that they would not share the results of the investigation. This lack of transparency has provoked a hurricane of rumors among W.P.P. executives and the advertising community.", "In the media-and-advertising world, Sorrell and W.P.P. are consequential. The world’s largest advertising-and-marketing conglomerate annually dispenses seventy-five billion advertising dollars to newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and digital companies, including Google and Facebook. In the ad world, no one is a bigger celebrity than Sorrell, whom the ", " chose to feature in its own advertising.", "What seems clear is that the board would not have shot Sorrell if he had not committed a serious infraction. However, the board had said earlier that the “allegations” against Sorrell “do not involve amounts which are material to W.P.P.” And, after shooting him, the board treated his departure as a retirement rather than a termination, allowing him to continue to enjoy stock grants and inviting him to be “available to assist with the transition.” Gracious? Perhaps. Transparent? About as transparent as Facebook.", "What is clear, a securities expert said, is that the true reasons for Sorrell’s dismissal will eventually get out, despite the N.D.A.s. By early this week, he predicted, “the S.E.C. will be announcing an investigation, as will the Financial Conduct Authority, in England.” Shareholder lawsuits will demand that the company define what “material” amounts are. For a company with almost twenty-one billion dollars of revenue, and with Sorrell earning sixty-eight million dollars last year, is a hundred thousand dollars material? Is five million? Is twenty?", "Meanwhile, a professional obituary for Sorrell, seventy-three, seems in order. Sorrell’s Jewish grandparents immigrated to London from Ukraine, Poland, and Romania. In the poorer East End of London, his grandparents and parents felt the lash of anti-Semitism, a reason that they changed the family name from Spitzberg to Sorrell. To help support his family, his father, Jack, dropped out of school, at thirteen, abandoning the scholarship offered by the Royal College of Music, and eventually went to work as a manager for the brothers Max and Francis Stone, Russian Jews who owned appliance stores. By the time Martin was born, in February, 1945, Jack was the managing director of their seven hundred and fifty stores, and the Sorrells enjoyed a measure of comfort. After a brother died, in childbirth, Martin became the recipient of the full attention of Sally and Jack Sorrell.", "Jack Sorrell was a presence in his son’s cluttered second-floor London town-house office, in a residential mews at 27 Farm Street, in Mayfair. The largest photograph in the room, dwarfing all the framed small photographs on the credenza leaning against the bare white wall facing his desk, is that of Jack Sorrell. It is unframed and slightly faded. The picture portrays a man of regal mien, his full mustache trimmed, his eyes dark, his black hair combed straight back, his formal dark suit accompanied by a black tie with white polka dots and a white pocket square. There is a hint of a smile on Jack Sorrell’s closed mouth, as if he were suppressing it. There is little physical resemblance between father and son. Martin’s hair is grayer and shorter, he wears unframed eyeglasses, and he is mustache-free. Unlike his father, he thinks of himself as an entrepreneur who is unabashedly proud to say that he personally built the W.P.P. from a wire-basket company to the world’s largest advertising-and-marketing entity. Like his father, Martin does not suffer fools and carries a chip on his shoulder. “My father,” his son said, “never felt he had the advantages—because he had to leave school at thirteen, he couldn’t take the scholarship. He had a very good brain, but he was probably upset that he worked like a slave but was not an owner . . . .We were so close because he wanted to give me the advantages he didn’t have.”", "The historian ", ", who met Martin when they were eleven-year-old students at the well-regarded Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School, in northwest London, described Martin as “exuberantly tough” and “full of a kind of cuddly warmth” that is often camouflaged. They were “brotherly close,” he said, with sterling grades, when together they entered Christ’s College, Cambridge, in 1963. On Fridays, Martin’s mother would wrap a roast chicken in silver foil and plastic and put it on the train to Cambridge. “I would pick it up,” Martin recalled. “The chicken was still warm.” Schama would make risotto to accompany the chicken. The chicken was kosher, as was all their food. “We were slightly left-wing Zionists” living", " a semi-bohemian life style, Schama said. Together, they edited and published a glossy magazine, ", ", appearing six times a year, each edition devoted to a single subject.", "Among Cambridge classmates, it was common to aspire to be a writer, professor, or lawyer. Martin was different. An economics major, his determination to be a businessman was “steely,” Schama said. “Martin always felt that Jack had been mistreated, he had been disadvantaged” by the Stone brothers and by early poverty. “Martin certainly wanted to vindicate his father by succeeding.” He graduated from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. One of his first jobs was to work for Mark McCormack, the founder and chairman of I.M.G., an international agent for sports figures and celebrities. He opened an I.M.G. office in London and worked there until the early seventies, when he joined James Gulliver Associates, as a financial adviser. The firm had invested in an ad agency that acquired Saatchi & Saatchi, and, in 1976, when Saatchi was searching for a chief financial officer, Sorrell was recruited. For the next nine years, he worked for Maurice and Charles Saatchi, often terrifying those sitting across from him as he crunched numbers in his head, stared down opponents, and orchestrated a spree of mergers that would transform Saatchi into a powerful holding company.", "As was true in most giant industries, the belief that size conferred advantages was rampant. Size offered leverage to raise prices and lower costs, provided a bigger global footprint to pitch clients anywhere, enabled synergies that granted efficiencies, and boosted profits by applying cost-cutting pressure on newly acquired assets to improve the parent company’s margins.", "The Saatchis had realized that the industry was evolving into two tiers, a handful of giants versus Saatchi and everyone else in the middle, where they were prey.", "In the nine years he worked there, Sorrell was often referred to as “the third brother,” an identity he rejects, because he says that the brothers were shrewd strategists unto themselves and that he was very clearly their employee.", "“The great thing about the Saatchis is they let you do what you wanted to do,” Sorrell said, adding, “as long as you got no public credit for it.”", "“I don’t remember him being very happy,” Schama recalled. Sorrell said, “I left them because I wanted to do something on my own. I was forty years old and had male menopause.” Plus, he aimed not to suffer the fate of his father. “Some things I found difficult to accept. My dad had always said to me, ‘Build a reputation in an industry you enjoy.’ And building a reputation means that people respect what you did and, as a result, you get some leverage and clout.” Until Jack Sorrell died, in 1989, Martin spoke with his father daily.", "With an eye on leaving, in 1985, Sorrell made a personal investment in a wire-basket manufacturer, publicly listed as Wire and Plastic Products. When he left Saatchi, the following year, he rechristened this shell company W.P.P. and set up shop in a one-room London office that he shared with an associate. His ownership stake in W.P.P. amounted to sixteen per cent. During the next eighteen months, W.P.P. purchased eighteen companies. “We went from a market cap of one million pounds to one hundred and fifty million pounds,” Sorrell said. Up until this time, ad agencies were gentlemanly, refusing to launch hostile takeovers. Sorrell disdained these polite unwritten rules. By 1987, the shark was ready to swallow a whale: he made a hostile bid to take over the venerable but troubled J. Walter Thompson, whose revenues were thirteen times greater than W.P.P.’s. Sorrell loaded up with debt and benefitted from a Japanese real-estate investment that was part of the acquisition and that eased the financial impact of the five-hundred-and-sixty-six-million-dollar purchase, which included the world’s largest public-relations firm, Hill & Knowlton.", "Sorrell would build his empire, as Jack Welch would build General Electric in that period, by purchasing companies, not starting them. Sorrell would erect the first financially successful advertising holding company. Within two years, he doubled Thompson’s profits. By 1989, he engineered a hostile takeover of Ogilvy & Mather, for eight hundred and sixty-four million dollars, prompting David Ogilvy to publicly brand him “an odious little shit.” (Martin is five feet six and a half inches tall—“same height as Napoleon,” as he likes to say. More than one press account of Ogilvy’s attack changed “shit” to “jerk.”) Soon, he would swallow two other huge agencies, Young & Rubicam and Grey. W.P.P. would grow to two hundred and five thousand employees in three thousand offices in a hundred and twelve countries. By 2017, W.P.P. enjoyed profit margins of just over seventeen per cent, the industry’s highest. He kept those margins high by aggressively diversifying W.P.P. from a company reliant on North America and Great Britain to a company that produced up to fifty per cent of its revenues from the faster-growing nations. China today is W.P.P.’s third-biggest revenue producer, with thirteen thousand employees, and W.P.P. has a fifty per cent market share in India. Sorrell was knighted Sir Martin by the Queen, in 2000, and chose “Persistence and Speed” for the motto on his shield.", "Sir Martin’s ambitions brought W.P.P. perilously close to bankruptcy in 1991. A combination of taking on convertible preferred shares, coupled with a worldwide recession, slashed W.P.P.’s stock price and revenues", " and menaced his dream. Banks were pressing him for payments. Schama recalled a lunch with him when Sorrell shared that W.P.P. was “in real deep trouble and close to going under.” To extricate his company, Sorrell humbly accepted a deal that reduced W.P.P.’s debt by granting its equity to the banks.", "By 1992, W.P.P. regained its stride. It has historically acquired about fifty companies annually and aggressively bought majority or minority stakes in marketing companies all over the world. According to W.P.P.’s Web site, it owns all or part of four hundred and twelve companies operating in a hundred and twelve countries. Enter the bright yellow door to its two-story London brownstone, walk past a fake cactus plant, settle on a short faux-leather visitors’ couch, and you find yourself staring up at a massive mounted orange drum. On it, in small black letters, are the names of W.P.P. companies. A sleek office building on a nearby street houses many of them. Its public-relations holdings include Hill & Knowlton, Burson-Marsteller, and Finsbury; its data, technology, and polling companies include Xaxis, Kantar, the Benenson Strategy Group, and Penn Schoen Berland; its public-affairs and lobbying roster includes the Dewey Square Group, Glover Park Group, and Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates; its various companies are major players in health-care communications, design, and direct mail. It owns sizable pieces of digital-content companies like Vice Media, Refinery29, the former Weinstein Company, and Fullscreen. It owns a fifth of a digital-measurement company that competes with Nielsen and the merged Rentrak and comScore. Back when she was recruited by Sorrell to become the C.E.O. of Ogilvy & Mather and became a trusted colleague, Charlotte Beers said, “I disagreed with him buying all these below-the-line companies. I was wrong. It’s why my W.P.P. stock is so strong today.”", "Currently, three-quarters of W.P.P.’s more than twenty billion dollars in revenues spring from what Sorrell described as “stuff that has nothing to do with Don Draper advertising” and everything to do with “media, data and digital.” W.P.P., like the other ad and marketing giants, set out to acquire not just advertising but marketing agencies. Today, outside the U.S., most marketing dollars are spent in England, France, Germany, Japan, and China. But late in the last century one did not need a crystal ball to see that China and India would each house more than a billion people. The two countries now rank No. 1 and No. 2 in number of Internet users. “In Don Draper’s day,” Sorrell, who devoutly watched every episode of “Mad Men,” said, “he was wrestling with working with the New York office or the Chicago office or the Detroit office and would be very focussed on the United States. The U.S. was the biggest market. It still is. But when I started, thirty years ago, up to three-quarters of worldwide advertising was controlled from the East Coast of the U.S. That’s no longer the story.”", "Those who worked for Sorrell, like those who worked for the younger Rupert Murdoch, always felt that he was watching them. Sorrell answered e-mails almost instantly, on his BlackBerry, even when attending tennis matches at Wimbledon. Miles Young, before he voluntarily stepped down as the C.E.O. of Ogilvy, said that he got “three to four e-mails a day from him. I’m a great fan of his. He has an ability to be broad and strategic when needed, but at the same time he has the ability to be very detail-oriented.”", "The incessant e-mails helped to forge his reputation as a micromanager, as did his fecund memory for promised but unmet executive goals. More than a few W.P.P. executives, not wanting to be quoted, complained that Sorrell nearly suffocated them with his over-their-shoulder attention to detail. Any claim that he is a micromanager is “a compliment,” Sorrell said, explaining that the C.E.O. of a company whose size is equal to “a mini-state” must delve into details.", "To understand what Sorrell was like as a manager, one has to begin with his self-identity as a founder. He flicks aside the shareholder critics, not to mention Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, who railed against his steep pay—forty-three million pounds in 2014, 70.4 million pounds in 2015, making him the highest-compensated executive in England. In an op-ed piece he wrote for the ", ", in June, 2012, Sorrell declared, “I have been behaving as an owner, rather than as a ‘highly paid manager.’ If that is so, mea culpa. I thought that was the object of the exercise, to behave like an owner and entrepreneur and not a bureaucrat.” Today, he owns just under two per cent of W.P.P. and chooses not to diversify his investments but to tie his wealth to how his company performs. “My dad said, ‘Invest with companies you know best,’ ” he said. Perhaps his sense of entitlement provoked the clash with his board.", "Sorrell amassed detractors. In London, he is called “6/21” behind his back, because June 21st is the year’s shortest night, and he is thus the shortest “knight.” One can fill notebooks with the criticism heaped upon Sorrell. He is feared, and privately scorned, by competitors and many colleagues. But critics don’t paint a complete picture. If we just froze the picture when David Ogilvy called him “an odious little shit,” we would miss what happened next. After they met for the first time, Ogilvy wrote to", " Sorrell, “To my surprise, I liked you. . . . I was flattered when you quoted my books, and even more so when you invited me to become Chairman of your company, which goes by the name WPP. I accepted your invitation. . . . It remains for me to tell you that I am sorry I was so offensive to you—", "” When Ogilvy was dying, of cancer, Sorrell visited him and promised to look after his wife. He did, and, according to Miles Young, the former C.E.O. of Ogilvy & Mather, “it was Martin who paid for Ogilvy’s nurses.”", "In recent months, Sorrell and the agency business suffered financial hits, as clients curbed ad spending, competition intensified, and agencies lowered their future financial projections and their stocks got hammered. Sorrell may have misjudged the falloff by blaming clients for curbing marketing spending that he said assured growth, and proclaiming that, once he induced W.P.P. employees to work “horizontally” in integrated teams to better serve clients, business would prosper. But what if the falloff was caused by something more profound—an existential crisis brought about by the Internet, which eliminates middlemen like agencies, and by consumers, who increasingly hate being interrupted by ads?", "The definitive answer to that question will not come anytime soon. In the meantime, Sorrell’s forced departure from W.P.P. is a stain on an unusually successful business legacy. A senior W.P.P. executive, saddened by Sorrell’s departure, was reminded of the famed wrestler Dan Gable: “He had a stellar career, and yet a blemish unfairly marred it. Gable was one of the great wrestlers in college and the Olympics. He was undefeated—until he lost his last match.”", "”"]},

As Georgia’s House Minority Leader, Abrams, a Democrat, was the first woman to lead either party in the state’s general assembly. Since graduating from Spelman College and Yale Law School—in between, she got a master’s degree from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, at the University of Texas—she has worked as a tax attorney in Atlanta, co-founded a financial-services firm, and created the ", " to register hundreds of thousands of voters, particularly people of color, young people, and unmarried women. Abrams has also written eight “romantic suspense” novels, half of them published by HarperCollins, under the name ", ". Abrams has said that she created the pen name to keep her fiction separate from the papers on tax law she was also publishing at the time; she happened to be watching a documentary about Elizabeth Montgomery, who played the lead on “Bewitched,” when she chose the name. Abrams has a book under own name, “", ",” coming out later this month.", "On Saturday, I went to see Abrams speak at the International Longshoremen’s Association, in Savannah. Prior to her arrival, scores of dockworkers were milling about, checking their schedules, playing Ping-Pong, catching up with colleagues and friends. Of the dozen men I spoke to outside the I.L.A., all of them African-American, Wali Johnson, a man in his sixties selling watermelons from the back of his truck, was the only one who had heard of Abrams. “All I know is that she’s running for governor,” he said. Should Abrams win in November, she would be Georgia’s first Democratic governor in fifteen years, its first black governor, and the first black woman to be the governor of any state in the country. “I don’t care if they’re Republican, Democrat, black, white, or Chinese,” Johnson said, of politicians generally. “I just want them to do the right thing and don’t forget about us in the African-American neighborhoods.”", "An hour later, Abrams stood before a crowd of about eighty in the main room of the I.L.A. Thomas L. Hart, a pastor at the nearby Brownsville Missionary Baptist Church, rose to clap when she arrived. He first saw Abrams speak last fall and was immediately won over. “She’s the right person at the right moment,” he told me. Abrams gave a half-hour stump speech that was by turns moving and funny, and that managed to feel nearly spontaneous. She was born in Wisconsin, but her family didn’t stay long—she only remembers “the cold and cheese curds,” she said. She spent most of her childhood in Gulfport, Mississippi, where her family was part of what her mother called “the genteel poor,” which meant that “we had no money, but we watched PBS and read books,” Abrams said. When the family’s water was cut off, her mother would call the resulting situation “urban camping.” For a time, Abrams’s mother was a librarian, while her father was employed as a dockworker. When the family moved to Atlanta, they both became Methodist ministers—“thus guaranteeing that they would be permanently poor.” She and her five siblings were “saved by public education,” Abrams said. One of them is now a professor of anthropology. Another, who also attended Yale Law School, is a federal judge. A third is a social worker.", "Abrams’s brother Walter is the exception. She described him as “a drug addict, who committed crimes to support his habit.” A few years ago, Walter, who has bipolar disorder, went to jail. He got out and promptly relapsed, reoffended, and returned to jail. A week ago, he was released again. Abrams presented his story as evidence of the need for criminal-justice reform, improved public education, and an expanded Medicaid, as well as a better understanding of mental illness. “He still can’t get a job,” she said. “He still doesn’t have health insurance. And he still has to figure out where he’s gonna live.”", "When I sat down with Abrams after her speech, she told me that she’d been considering a run for a major public office in Georgia since she joined the state legislature, in 2007. She thought about running for mayor of Atlanta. “But I realized that the scale of the issues and the capacity to really address poverty and the attendant issues could only be done through the role of governor,” she said. Watching Virginia and ", " turn blue last year, she decided that now was the time. “Georgia is not a red state,” she had told the crowd earlier. “It’s just blue and confused.”", "Before Abrams can try to prove that claim, she has to defeat Stacey Evans, a former member of the Georgia legislature, in the Democratic primary, which will be held on May 22nd. Evans is white; people have been calling the candidates ", ". (Evans was widely criticized for an ad she released in January, in which ", " are awkwardly melded.) Most of the close observers of Georgia politics whom I’ve spoken to think that Abrams will win the Democratic nomination, and believe that she has an outside shot in November, when she would likely face Casey Cagle, Georgia’s lieutenant governor, and ", " to succeed the", " Republican incumbent Nathan Deal, who has served the office’s maximum of two terms.", "I asked Abrams—who became known to many Georgians last year, after white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, when she advocated removing ", ", a two-acre carving of Confederate generals on Stone Mountain, just outside of Atlanta—whether she considers herself a progressive Democrat. ", ", the last liberal Georgian to become nationally famous trying to win political office here, she said that she did. She added, “I’m also a pragmatist.” In a state House vote last year on ", ", a Georgia bill that changed the liability standard for bank executives, Abrams ", ", prompting The Intercept to ", " “Georgia Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Voted With G.O.P. to Make It Harder to Hold Bank Executives Accountable.” Abrams insisted that she does not regret this vote. “It was a bill that achieved the best outcome,” she told me, “which is to hold bad actors accountable and to hold those who operate in good faith—give them the capacity to defend themselves if something goes wrong.” The recent Atlanta mayoral candidate and former state senator Vincent Fort, a Democrat known for his work to stop predatory lending, disagrees. “Bottom line,” he told The Intercept, “the bill would allow for the same kind of abuses in subprime banking that we saw in the nineties and two-thousands.”", "Abrams’s voter-registration efforts might be described as both progressive and pragmatic. The groups targeted by the New Georgia Project are likely to vote for Democrats, and expanding the voter rolls strengthens Abrams’s chances. (Abrams is no longer the organization’s C.E.O.) Georgia has a long history of voter suppression, and its current secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is a prominent proponent of voter-I.D. laws. In 2014, Kemp memorably expressed concern, to a group of fellow-Republicans, that Democrats were registering “", ",” and said that Republicans needed to register their own voters in order to keep up. A couple of months later, he launched ", " into Abrams’s New Georgia Project. The organization has also been subject to ", ", totalling thirteen thousand dollars, for unpaid employment contributions. Abrams blamed these on clerical errors.", "Kemp is now also running for governor.

Cagle has pushed “religious liberty” legislation that would allow faith-based organizations and individuals who cite a religious belief or moral conviction regarding marriage to opt out of serving couples or adhering to anti-discrimination requirements—despite opposition from the current governor and the metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. “He has used a faith that we share in common, Christianity, to justify discrimination, which I find abominable,” Abrams said. In Cagle, Abrams sees a “willingness to foment discrimination and bigotry and to do so in a way that undermines the economic capacity of our state.”", "Cagle made national headlines in late February, when, following the mass shooting at a school in ", ", the Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines decided to stop offering discounts to members of the National Rifle Association. Incensed, Cagle declared, ", ", “I will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with NRA.

In an\naddress to the nation, Trump also sent a tough message to Russia and\nIran, the two governments that have provided the air and ground power\nthat have allowed Syria’s President, Bashar al-Assad, to regain control of\nmost of Syria in the past year. “What kind of a nation\nwants to be associated with the mass murderer of innocent men, women,\nand children?” the President said. “Nations can be judged by the friends\nthey keep.” He called Assad’s use of chemical weapons “not the actions\nof a man. They are crimes of a monster instead.”", "The Pentagon identified three Syrian targets—a research-and-development\nfacility in the Damascus area and two facilities near Homs, including a\ncommand post and a storage facility for chemical weapons and their\nprecursors. It said the targets were selected to minimize the risk to\nSyrian civilians. Defense Secretary James Mattis called the operation a “one-time shot” that was aimed at sending a strong message to “Assad and his\nmurderous lieutenants.” But the Pentagon also said that it reserved the\nright to undertake further operations if Syria deploys chemical weapons\nagain. Mattis called Syria’s repeated use of chemical weapons\n“atrocities” that violate all norms of civilized behavior. “It is time\nfor all civilized nations to end the Syrian civil war by backing the\nU.N. peace process,” he told reporters.", "In his address, the President vowed that the United States and its\nallies “are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime\nstops its use of prohibited chemical agents.” Ending the use of chemical\nweapons is “a vital national-security interest of the United States,” he\nsaid. Syria has used weaponized toxic poisons at least fifty times\nduring the seven-year war, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley,\ncharged on Friday.", "Trump specifically blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for failing\nto keep Russia’s promise, in 2013, to eliminate Syria’s stockpile.\nMoscow, Trump said, must decide whether to “continue down this path” of\naiding and abetting the Assad regime, or to “join with civilized nations\nas a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday, we’ll get along\nwith Russia, and maybe even Iran—but maybe not.”", "In the official assessment of Syria’s chemical-weapons program, the\nWhite House charged that the Assad regime “threatens to desensitize the\nworld to their use and proliferation, weaken prohibitions against their\nuse, and increase the likelihood that additional states will acquire and\nuse these weapons.” It said Russia had not only shielded the Assad\nregime from accountability for its chemical weapons but had also used\nits own nerve agent in an attempted assassination in the United Kingdom\nlast month, “showing an uncommonly brazen disregard for the taboo\nagainst chemical weapons.”", "In London, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the joint\nmilitary operation “is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not\nabout regime change. It is about a limited and targeted strike that does\nnot further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything\npossible to prevent civilian casualties.” Syria and its supporters had\ngiven the West no “practicable alternative,” other than the use of\nforce, to prevent the further use of chemical weapons by Syria, she\nsaid. She added that the operation “will also send a clear signal to\nanyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.”", "Social-media users in Syria posted photos and videos of flashes that\nappeared to be detonations. In Damascus, Syrian state television broke\ninto late-night programming to report that its defense forces had just begun\na counteroffensive against “America, French and British aggression” and\nhad shot down thirteen U.S. Tomahawk missiles. The Pentagon said it\nwould not have an assessment until Saturday, but acknowledged that Syria\nfired surface-to-air missiles in response to the strikes. Mattis warned\nthat he expected a “disinformation campaign” by Syria and its allies.", "The strike immediately heightened tensions beyond the Middle East, most\nnotably between Washington and Moscow. Even before the onslaught, a\ngrowing new Cold War threatened to become a hot one when Russia warned\nthat it would shoot down any missiles fired at Syria—and counterattack\nthe sites from which they were fired. “The missiles will be downed and\neven the sources from which the missiles were fired,” Alexander\nZasypkin, the Kremlin’s ambassador to Lebanon, had boasted, earlier this\nweek. But Russia appears not to have engaged in an immediate\ncounterstrike.", "The joint U.S.-British-French operation sent Russia the third message in\nrecent weeks about its growing political and military intervention\nacross the world. Putin has long been Syria’s most important ally. He\nhas propped up Assad with arms and airpower—and has protected him with\nRussia’s veto power at the United Nations.", "Moscow has repeatedly dismissed the reports of a Syrian government\nchemical-weapons attack in Douma, a besieged suburb of Damascus held by\nrebels, as a “hoax.” More than forty were reportedly killed, and hundreds\nwere injured. Russia claimed that its military representatives visiting Douma found no\ntraces of toxic agents. On Friday, the Pentagon countered that it had\nevidence of Assad’s military deploying chlorine and possibly a sarin nerve\nagent in Douma last Saturday. “Assad uses chemical weapons in a manner\nto maximize suffering, such as", " against families huddled in underground\nshelters, as was seen in Douma—a population that was already negotiating\nfor surrender and evacuation,” the White House assessment stated.", "The operation also displayed Western unity at a time when several cracks\nhave emerged in the transatlantic alliance. It followed a week of\nintense negotiations among Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron,\nand the British Prime Minister. It is the second time in the past month that\nWestern nations have taken decisive action together. The other was the\njoint expulsion of Russian intelligence officers to retaliate for the\nattempted assassination of a former Russian spy, in which chemical\nweapons were used.", "For Trump, the military strike on Syria could have a rippling impact on\nhis standing, both abroad and at home. It showed resolve in advance of\nhis summit with Kim Jong Un on North Korea’s arsenal, which includes at\nleast twenty nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles capable of hitting\nanywhere in the United States. The summit—pitting a real-estate developer\nwith little foreign-policy experience against a dictator whose family\nhas held power for seven decades—is tentatively scheduled for May or\nearly June. The Syria strike displayed the President’s willingness to\nresort to force when diplomacy fails.", "It could also boost the President’s approval rating. Trump’s popularity\njumped to forty-three percent—and his disapproval rating dropped—after\nhis first air strike on Syria, in April of 2017. Fifty-seven per cent of\nAmericans approved of the operation, in which fifty-nine cruise missiles\nwere fired on a largely abandoned airfield used by Syrian warplanes that\nhad dropped sarin gas on the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing\ndozens. (Sarin, one of the world’s deadliest chemical weapons, was first\ndeveloped by the Nazis.) The 2017 air strike won wide support among\nRepublicans in Congress who had balked at authorizing the use of force\nafter President Obama drew a “red line” on Syria’s use of chemical\nweapons in 2013.", "At least temporarily, the strike also diverts domestic attention from\nspecial counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which has gotten\nincreasingly close to the President’s inner circle. On Monday, the F.B.I.\nseized documents from Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, reportedly\nincluding financial records related to payments to silence two women who\nclaimed to have had adulterous affairs with the President.", "Yet the impact of the U.S.-led strike will be limited in the long term,\nand the attack contradicts Trump’s long-stated aversion to getting\nentangled in foreign wars. It is unlikely to have enduring impact on the\noutcome of the Syrian civil war, which is now in its eighth year. The\nAssad regime has consolidated control over most of the country and all\nits major cities. Last week, Trump ordered his generals to withdraw the\ntwo thousand U.S. forces currently in Syria within the next four to six\nmonths. Pulling out American troops—who have been advising the rebel\nSyrian Democratic Forces in the campaign to defeat ", "—will limit U.S.\ninfluence on the ground and on Syria’s political future."]},

As a case in point, in 2016, the Election Assistance Commission, the bipartisan federal agency that certifies the integrity of voting machines, and that will now be tasked with administering Congress’s three hundred and eighty million dollars, was itself hacked. The stolen data—log-in credentials of E.A.C. staff members—were discovered, by chance, by employees of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, whose computers one night happened upon an informal auction of the stolen passwords. “This guy—we randomly called him Rasputin—was in a high-profile forum in the darkest of the darkest of the darkest corner of the dark Web, where hackers and reverse engineers, ninety-nine per cent of them Russian, hang out,”  Christopher Ahlberg, the C.E.O. of Recorded Future, told me. “There was someone from another country in the forum who implied he had a government background, and he wanted to get his hands on this stuff. That’s when we decided we would just buy it. So we did, and took it to the government”—the U.S. government—“and the sale ended up being thwarted.” (Ahlberg wouldn’t identify which government agency his company had turned the data over to. The E.A.C., in a statement, referred questions about “the investigation or information shared with the government by Recorded Future” to the F.B.I. The F.B.I., through a Justice Department spokesperson, declined to comment.)", "Another case to consider: the Department of Homeland Security recently ", " a number of rogue cell-phone simulators—technical tools that are commonly called “Stingrays”—in Washington, D.C., and has been unable to identify who was operating them. Stingrays are typically used in this country by police or intelligence agencies to surveil suspects and intercept their communications, but D.H.S. officials suspect that the ones they found may have been part of a foreign government’s spying arsenal. As a pair of Princeton computer scientists, Andrew Appel and Kyle Jamieson, have pointed out, cell-phone simulators, which mimic legitimate cell towers, happen also to be handy and inexpensive vote-hacking devices. On the ", ", Appel and Jamieson have posted easy-to-follow diagrams showing how the transmission of voting information from polling places could be intercepted by a Stingray and surreptitiously altered before being sent on to its intended destination, a central tabulating computer.", "The voting machine that Appel and Jamieson picked to illustrate this hypothetical “man-in-the-middle” attack was the DS200, a popular optical-scan voting machine that reads marked paper ballots, made by a company called Election Systems & Software. The DS200 machine is not connected to the Internet, a feature that offers a great deal of protection from hacking—but not absolute protection. As the Princeton professors demonstrate, trusting this “air gap” when there are other points of entry into the system—such as, in the DS200’s case, a modem that sends data over phone lines—is both naïve and dangerous. When I contacted Election Systems & Software for a comment on the machine’s susceptibility to hacking, I was sent an explanatory leaflet called “Modeming as It Relates to Unofficial Results Transmission.” That document catalogues a number of security features that, on their face, would appear to prevent interception. “Only unofficial results are ever transmitted via modem,” the document says, and, even then, all transmissions are encrypted. The company says these safeguards make the Stingray-aided hacking of their machines “highly unlikely.” But, as Appel told me, there is nothing stopping poll workers from sending official results via modem, and encryption only works if the software of the sender and that of the receiver are implemented perfectly. That, he said, rattling off the many ways an encrypted system could be penetrated, rarely happens. And, despite the security features of the DS200, the danger posed by sending voting data over phone lines has convinced several states—including New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Alabama—to prohibit the use of modems for the transmission of election results.", "One of the enduring myths about American elections, and one that persists even after the revelations of 2016, is that they are largely insulated from hacking because we have no centralized voting system—elections are overseen by roughly nine thousand counties, and voting takes place in over a hundred and fifty thousand polling places—and because most voting occurs offline. “Our diverse and locally-run election process presents serious obstacles to carrying out large-scale cyberattacks to disrupt elections, and that standalone, disconnected voting systems present a low risk,” the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote last year, in a ", " titled “Key Facts and Findings on Cybersecurity and Foreign Targeting of the 2016 US Elections.” Yet the intelligence community, computer scientists, and hackers themselves have found that while decentralization may be a deterrent, it is not a defense.", "In their briefing paper, the secretaries of state—twenty-four of whom are their state’s chief election official—also contend that “the November 2016 election was not hacked.” Though Russian agents ", " the voting systems of at least twenty states and, in one of them, Illinois, lifted thirty-five hundred complete voter files and parts of ninety thousand more, “compromising voter registration systems,” the secretaries say that did “not affect election results.” This extremely limited understanding of hacking fails to take into", " account that compromising voter-registration systems—eliminating voters from the rolls, deleting voting histories in ways that cause voters to be purged from the system, or creating discrepancies between a state’s voter registry and the poll books used on Election Day—can disenfranchise voters, and disenfranchising voters can change outcomes.", "Even without foreign interference, elections in recent years have been marred by software glitches, clerical errors, and machine failures that have prevented people from voting, caused long lines at polling places, and prompted some voters to give up and walk away. (In 2006, for instance, it has been ", " that twenty per cent of voters in Denver were dissuaded from voting after a software failure led to long lines.) If these bugs were to be turned into features and deployed systematically by malicious actors, as Michael Daniel, the Obama Administration’s “cyber czar” pointed out recently, on “60 Minutes,” chaos would ensue. On the same program, Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California, said, “We have to be prepared for wars without blood.”", "The last time Congress sent money to the states to upgrade their voting infrastructure was in 2002, when it passed the Help America Vote Act (", "). That law set aside $3.6 billion to replace the punch-card voting machines that nearly caused a constitutional crisis in the 2000 election. The three hundred and eighty million dollars that Congress recently authorized ", " unspent ", " grants, and are intended to replace the replacement machines purchased a decade and a half ago, most of which have outlived their use-by date.

Some of these machines are so old that their operating systems can’t be patched when security flaws are found, and replacement parts must be scrounged up on eBay.", "Significantly, hackers were not responsible when, in November, 2016, voters in Shelby County, Tennessee, pulled the lever for Hillary Clinton and ", " they had chosen Donald Trump. Nor were hackers behind flipped votes reported in a number of precincts in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Texas, and North Carolina. These kinds of mishaps become more common as machines age. The glue used to affix voting screens degrades, resulting in screens that are no longer in alignment with ballots. When that happens, as it did to a woman in Davidson County, Tennessee, during the 2008 Presidential election, you get ", ": “A poll worker directed me to a touch screen voting machine and instructed me how to use it. I touched ‘Obama’ for president and nothing lit up. I touched 2 or 3 more times and still nothing lit up. … I tried it 2 or 3 more times more lightly with the poll worker watching and still nothing lit up. The poll worker then touched it for me twice—nothing lit up. The third time he touched the Obama button, the Cynthia McKinney space lit up! … The poll worker just kind of laughed and cancelled the vote. He hit the Obama button again and it finally lit up. I continued on to cast the rest of my votes. After completing the process and reviewing my votes, I went to the VOTE page, hit the VOTE button and nothing happened. Again, after several tries, I called the poll worker over and he finally got the machine to register my votes. Hurray—I voted!—or did I?”", "But it’s not just decrepitude. Software vulnerabilities, unreliable tabulators, and unprotected memory cards have left voting systems open to exploitation ever since electronic machines were introduced. Most problematic have been machines known as D.R.E.s (direct-recording electronic devices), which do not provide voters with a paper record of their choices. Like that woman from Tennessee, maybe their votes are counted, and maybe they aren’t, and there is no way to know.", "This not knowing was the catalyst for a class-action lawsuit brought against the Pennsylvania secretary of state in 2006. “Because there is no permanent, independent physical record that can be used to audit the DRE, either in random audits or following an accusation that the machine has been tampered with or has malfunctioned,” the plaintiffs wrote, “there can be no assurance that either the Petitioners’ votes or the votes of any other Pennsylvania voter have been properly counted or weighted.” Nine years after that suit was filed, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs, and the machines at issue remain in use. This past March, after the special election between Conor Lamb and Rick Saccone to represent Pennsylvania’s Eighteenth Congressional District, which Lamb, the Democrat, won, by a few hundred votes, Republican officials in Washington demanding a recount might have wished the lawsuit had gone the other way.", "Pennsylvania is one of thirteen states that continue to use D.R.E.s. Counties all over the country have been slow to move away from first-generation electronic machines, despite their problems, since new voting systems are prohibitively expensive. The ", " money—which will be doled out according to a formula based on the voting-age population of each state, rather than the condition of election infrastructure—is meant to help defray these costs. Yet only two states, Delaware and Arkansas, will be getting enough money to retire their entire fleet of D.R.E.s. Pennsylvania, which is getting somewhere between fifty and seventy-nine million", " dollars, will at most be able to swap out twenty-seven per cent of its equipment. New Jersey, which votes exclusively on D.R.E.s, can expect to replace fewer than twenty-five per cent. And none of these machines are likely to arrive in time for the 2018 midterms, which, according to the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, is likely to be a “potential target for Russian influence operations.”", "Three hundred and eighty million dollars is not enough to change the threat landscape.

It’s encouraging.” Trump expressed optimism about the prospects of diplomacy after the Pompeo trip. “We have come a long way with North Korea,” Trump said at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “We’ve never been in a position like this with any regime, whether father, grandfather or son.” But he acknowledged the uncertainty of the initiative. “If we don’t think it will be successful, we won’t have it.

Pompeo, in turn, has made no secret of his desire to be shaping policy rather than assessing dangers.", "A graduate of West Point and Harvard Law School, Pompeo shares the President’s hawkish views on North Korea and Iran. He has suggested support for regime change in both countries. At the Aspen Security Forum last summer, Pompeo said it would be “a great thing to denuclearize the Peninsula,” but added that the “most dangerous” thing was “the character who holds the control over them today. So, from the Administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?” he said. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent and break those two apart.”", "During his confirmation hearing last week, Pompeo toned down his rhetoric on Kim. “Just to be clear, my role as a diplomat is to make sure that we never get to a place where we have to confront the difficult situation in Korea that this country has been headed for now for a couple of decades,” he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He’s now the front man doing the legwork to insure that Trump’s diplomatic gamble works—and that the United States does not have to find an alternative if it fails."]},

Caleb Gadly was lynched in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 1894, for walking behind the wife of his white employer. David Walker was accused of using inappropriate language with a white woman in Hickman, Kentucky, in 1908; he, his wife, and their four children were lynched.  Ballie Crutchfield, a woman, was lynched in Rome, Tennessee, in 1901, by a mob searching for her brother. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of white spectators would  show up to watch. They wore their Sunday best, posed for photos with their children, ate snacks, and drank soda and lemonade. Afterward, the body might be dragged through the streets of black neighborhoods. Often, body parts were cut off and collected as souvenirs.", "This week, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice opens in Montgomery, Alabama. Designed and built by the legal-advocacy group the Equal Justice Initiative, or E.J.I., it is an outdoor exhibit devoted to victims of lynching. Eight hundred and five rusting steel columns are geometrically arranged on a grassy hill. Each column is inscribed with the names of lynching victims and the county in which they were murdered. The columns are suspended from the ceiling above them, starting at eye level and then rising as the wooden floor slopes downward, evoking lifeless bodies hanging from trees. The accompanying Legacy Museum describes the history of American racial injustice, from enslavement to mass incarceration, and illustrates lesser-known aspects of that narrative, like the domestic slave trade.", "Alabama, my home state, is a place obsessed with its history and its founding myths. Whenever I fly into Montgomery and get on I-85 to drive to my parents’ home, I pass a highway exit sign advertising the “First White House of the Confederacy,” the former residence of Jefferson Davis. On a recent drive to northern Alabama, I saw a Confederate flag flying near an off-ramp,  planted there by an organization celebrating the descendants of Confederate veterans.", "Yet the state, especially its capital, has often overlooked its slave-holding origins. In 1860, two-thirds of the Montgomery county population was enslaved. Downtown Montgomery was once the site of slave warehouses and markets. Enslaved people were unloaded on Commerce Street at one end on the Alabama River and marched to auctions in Court Square. In 2013, E.J.I. installed historical markers at both places, but the scale and ambition of the memorial and museum are much greater. “Despite how dominant and central enslavement is to the history of this country, we don’t address it,” ", ", the founder of E.J.I., told me. “The visuals that most people carry around about slavery are very benign, very muted: enslaved people are depicted as happy and well fed and well treated.”", "E.J.I. has identified more than four thousand four hundred lynching victims, many of them unnamed, from eight hundred and five counties, mostly in the South. All lynchings occurred between 1877 and 1950. The organization says it is still receiving information about previously unknown murders. During its investigation, the group interviewed members of communities where the crimes took place and talked to relatives and descendants of people who had been killed.", "James Johnson, a retired schoolteacher in Abbeville, Alabama, told me that the memorial was “bittersweet” and overdue. His distant cousin, Wes Johnson, an eighteen-year-old tenant farmer, was accused of attacking a white woman and lynched in 1937. More than a hundred of his fellow-townsmen kidnapped him from jail, shot him, and hanged him. Johnson’s mother told him about the murder when he was a child. “She told me I had a cousin who was lynched, and she told me his name. As a little boy, I didn’t know what the word ‘lynched’ meant,” he recalled. “But it was a way of her telling me to be very careful. There are just certain things I can say, certain ways I’m supposed to look at people. I’m not supposed to touch certain people. It was for survival purposes.” After the lynching, Johnson’s relatives mostly stayed silent and kept to themselves, scared for their lives; some moved away. In the aftermath of a recent ", " on his cousin that featured him, Johnson said that he received several supportive, apologetic messages from white neighbors.", "From a distance, the lynching memorial appears serene, an architectural feat on a green knoll. But, as I entered the dense space, the serenity mutated into uneasiness. By the time the ground gave way, so that the monuments hovered above my head, the experience was devastating. Stevenson said one of the goals with the memorial is to force visitors to face the country’s past. “It’s so much easier to not be burdened by the history of slavery if you don’t see anything that’s burdensome or disruptive,” he said.", "The memorial has prompted a kind of reckoning in Montgomery. The Montgomery ", ", founded in 1829, recently began a ", " examining the way it had covered lynching in the past. The first installment demonstrated how the newspaper often engaged in empty moralizing on the violence of the act as it tried to justify the targeting of black Alabamians. “All right-thinking people deplore lynchings, but it is wise to utter a solemn truth, with the old, old lemon brought home again, as long as there are attempts at rape by black", " men, red men or yellow men on white women there will be lynchings,” an editorial from 1919 read. The coverage assumed black people were guilty, and so ultimately deserving of murder.", "It is a source of simultaneous pain and pride that Alabama’s progress has often been the result of force, of violent push and pull, among conflicting visions of the state, from the Civil War to the civil-rights movement and beyond. Throughout, the burden of guilt has usually been on black people to bear and to somehow escape. Now, a visitor to Montgomery can take a leisurely walk from the state capitol to a museum on the Confederacy, to another museum on the Freedom Riders. The memorial to the victims of lynching is a necessary addition to that landscape, if only to remind Alabamians, and other Americans, that the terror it represents will no longer be overlooked."]},

McConville was a widow, and a mother of ten; her children were home when she was abducted, and they screamed and clung to her legs. Her disappearance became known as one of the most notorious atrocities of the Troubles, the bloody, three-decade conflict that ravaged Northern Ireland. It was also, on a more basic level, a murder mystery. The McConville children were distributed to orphanages, and, growing up, they never knew what had happened to their mother. But it was long rumored that she had been killed by the Irish Republican Army, and, in 1999, the I.R.A. acknowledged that this was true. In a new documentary film, “I, Dolours,” which will be shown for the first time this weekend, at the Hot Docs festival, in Toronto, a former I.R.A. member, Dolours Price, describes in unprecedented detail the operation to kidnap, murder, and secretly bury McConville.", "Price grew up in Belfast, in a staunchly Irish Republican family. As a young woman at the outset of the Troubles, she joined a secretive I.R.A. unit, the Unknowns, and performed dangerous operations, including an audacious bombing of the Old Bailey in London, in 1973. But after the Good Friday Agreement, which ostensibly brought an end to the Troubles, in 1998, Price grew deeply disillusioned. She broke the I.R.A.’s code of silence and acknowledged, in press interviews, that she had played a role in McConville’s abduction: she said that she had driven McConville from Belfast across the border to Dundalk, in the Republic of Ireland, where another I.R.A. team executed her. Price also asserted that Gerry Adams, the Irish Republican politician who had helped engineer the peace agreement, was the person who gave her orders. Adams, who still maintains that he was never in the I.R.A., has strenuously denied this. (I wrote an ", " about this controversy in 2015, and am working on a book about the murder and its aftermath, “Say Nothing,” which will be published next year.)", "In 2010, Dolours Price agreed to speak at length about her I.R.A. career with the Bronx-based journalist Ed Moloney—on the condition that he not release the interview until after her death. They met in Dublin, where Price was living, and Moloney conducted a long videotaped interview. Price was not well at the time: she had struggled with alcohol and prescription pills, and been diagnosed with P.T.S.D.; she was being treated at a local psychiatric hospital. But in the interview she is composed, sober, and coherent. Price died in 2013, from a fatal overdose of prescription pills. As its title would suggest, “I, Dolours” is a testament: the only narration is Price’s voice. The film’s director, Maurice Sweeney, intersperses footage of Price during the interview—a pale woman with penetrating blue eyes, her hair short and platinum blond—with a series of evocative reënactments.", "The members of the Unknowns were selected for the secret unit because they “could be trusted with very specific jobs, obeying orders without question,” Price says. The unit was run by a man named Pat McClure, she continues. But McClure “reported back to the officer commanding in Belfast—who would have been Gerry Adams.” One of Price’s responsibilities was transporting people who had been marked for death out of Northern Ireland and across the border to the Republic of Ireland, where they would be killed. In one chilling section of the film, she recounts driving two I.R.A. men, Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, to their deaths. They had both committed what was regarded as the ultimate sin in the I.R.A.: becoming British informers. After they confessed, Wright and McKee were told that their lives would be spared, so they joined Price for that final ride without resistance, believing that they were going for a brief holiday in the south. “Ultimately, I believe they were shot,” Price says, adding, “We believed that informers were the lowest form of human life.” (The bodies of Wright and McKee were discovered, buried in an Irish bog, in 2015.)", "When Moloney asks Price about Jean McConville, she insists that McConville, too, was an informer. The I.R.A. has maintained for decades that McConville was murdered because she had been supplying information to the British Army. The children of Jean McConville—who today are parents and grandparents themselves—have angrily challenged this assertion, pointing out that Jean was a widowed mother of ten who would have had no access to sensitive information, much less the time to pass it along. A ", " by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, from 2006, also found no evidence that McConville was an informer.", "But Price insists that she was. In the film, she repeats an old story about how the I.R.A. had discovered a radio transmitter in McConville’s apartment, which she allegedly used to pass information to her handlers in the British Army. But Price also tells a new story: she says that several I.R.A. members were hauled into a barracks on Hastings Street, “to be identified by a person concealed behind a blanket.” The blanket had a slit in it, so that an informer could peer through and supply the authorities with the names of suspected paramilitary members. But the blanket “stopped short of her feet,” Price says—and the suspects realized that the person hiding on the other side", " was McConville, because they “recognized the slippers.” When she was interrogated by the I.R.A., McConville confessed, Price maintains, saying that she had agreed to help the British “for money.” (Whether the I.R.A. tortured McConville before extracting such a confession, Price does not say.)", "“Our first contact with her was to just pick her up,” Price says. Three members of the Unknowns—Price, Pat McClure, and a third—escorted McConville after her abduction in Belfast. McConville was not fearful for her life, Price notes, because they told her that she was not going to be killed but rather relocated by a charitable group, the Legion of Mary. McConville asked if her children could join her, and it was only at that moment, Price insists, that she realized that the widow whom she was transporting to her death had kids. Even so, she brought McConville to Dundalk, and handed her over to the local I.R.A. unit.", "Until the release of this documentary, that was the extent of Price’s involvement in the McConville case, so far as the public was aware: she drove McConville across the border and turned her over to the people who would end her life. But, in the film, Price reveals that her culpability did not end there. “They didn’t want to do it,” she says, of the local I.R.A. men. “They couldn’t bring themselves to execute her. Probably because she was a woman.”", "“So you guys had to do it?” Moloney asks.", "“There had been a grave dug by the Dundalk unit,” Price says. So she crossed the border again, back into the south, along with Pat McClure and the third member of the Unknowns. I.R.A. members don’t think of themselves as terrorists, preferring the word “volunteer,” a term that encapsulates a sense of romantic sacrifice: combatants like Price were willing to volunteer everything—even their own lives—for the cause of a united Ireland. But, of course, they were willing to volunteer the lives of others, too, and, as Price describes the murder of Jean McConville, she slips into the third person. It is clear in the film that she is acknowledging her own responsibility, yet she recounts the act as though it was carried out by someone else. McConville “was taken by the three volunteers to the grave, and shot in the back of the head by one of the volunteers,” Price tells Moloney. She does not say, in the film, which of the three fired the fatal shot. But she suggests that, in the manner of a firing squad, they deliberately assumed a shared responsibility. There was a single pistol, which they passed around. “The other two volunteers each fired a shot so that no one would say that they for certain had been the person to kill her,” Price says. This was a comforting fiction: after McConville’s bones were discovered, in 2003, by a man walking along a beach in Louth, a coroner ruled that the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head, and only one bullet was recovered with the bones. If the other two did fire shots, they missed. “She was left in the grave,” Price says. “The local unit buried her.”", "Pat McClure, the I.R.A. member present at the execution, is no longer alive. He moved to Connecticut in the nineteen-eighties, and died there in 1986. In “I, Dolours,” Price does not identify the third I.R.A. member, who may or may not be alive. But the authorities in Northern Ireland have arrested and subsequently released numerous people in connection with the McConville case—among them Gerry Adams, who was questioned for four days and then released without charges, in 2014. Only one person has been charged in association with McConville’s murder: a former I.R.A. official named Ivor Bell, who, the state alleges, played a role in aiding and abetting the operation. But Bell, who is in his eighties, has been diagnosed with dementia, and may never stand trial.", "Moloney’s full interview with Price was turned over to the Police Service of Northern Ireland in 2013, as part of a court proceeding involving an oral-history archive at Boston College. (Moloney had deposited the Price interview at the university, under the assumption that doing so would keep it safe, not knowing that the university might one day turn it over to detectives in Belfast.)", "“Do the disappeared haunt you?” Moloney asks Price, in the film.", "“Yes,” she replies. “I think back on those who I had responsibility for driving away. I’m not a deeply religious person, but I would say a prayer for them.” Moloney asks if she regards such forced disappearances as a war crime, and Price responds, “I think it’s a war crime. Yes.”"]},

He stands to be sentenced to as much as ten years for each conviction. The ", ", last June, for the same crimes, ", ", owing to a hung jury. Because the trial and the retrial divided neatly into pre- and post-", " events, Cosby’s case promised to show, in real time, the legal impact of a young social movement. Anticipating the decision was like girding for a verdict on the movement itself.", "Trial lawyers often say that cases are won or lost in jury selection. Judge Steven O’Neill, who also presided over the first Cosby trial, explicitly questioned the hundred and twenty potential Cosby jurors on whether they knew of the #MeToo movement and sexual-misconduct allegations in the entertainment industry—nearly all did—and, related, whether they could be impartial in assessing the trial evidence. The judge seemed to acknowledge that the effects of social shifts on ordinary sensibilities and common sense are features of the conscious design of our jury system. The twelve-person jury on the second trial was reportedly identical to that of the first in terms of racial and gender composition, but the second appeared to skew a bit younger, with more millennials in the mix—which was perhaps significant, given the much-noted generation gap in levels of support for #MeToo.", "The prosecution and the defense typically battle over what, among the available evidence, should be shown to or kept from the jury. A #MeToo effect could perhaps be seen here, as well: in the second trial, the judge permitted the jury to hear much more evidence than he did in the first. Constand’s account of Cosby assaulting her after he gave her pills that immobilized her was consistent across the two trials. On retrial, the new jury heard testimony from five additional women, who told similar stories of Cosby drugging and then assaulting them in the nineteen-eighties, whereas the first jury heard from only one other victim. ", " have come forward to accuse the entertainer of sexual assault, with the alleged incidents spanning a period of fifty years. Cosby has never been charged, and likely never will be, for these additional alleged crimes, because their statutes of limitations ran out before they came to light.", "In 1991, William Kennedy Smith, President John F. Kennedy’s nephew,was acquitted on a rape charge, with the jury presumably swayed by Smith’s claim that the sex was consensual. The case was widely thought to have turned on an evidentiary ruling: the trial judge’s exclusion of accounts by three additional women who each accused Smith of raping or attempting to rape them in the past. The jury was not permitted to hear this evidence because of the legal principle that the accused in a criminal case is to be tried only for the crime charged, not for his character or other conduct; “prior bad acts” are generally supposed to be inadmissible as evidence.", "Yet, during Cosby’s trial on charges of assaulting Constand, the jury did hear testimony from multiple additional alleged victims. (The prosecution originally wanted to introduce testimony from nineteen women.) The judge allowed the evidence under two interrelated possible exceptions to the rule excluding prior bad acts. First, the additional victims’ testimony could show a common plan or scheme, in which there is a logical connection between the alleged prior assaults and the charged crime—they are considered parts of a whole, overarching goal. Second, the additional testimony could show that Cosby did not think that Constand was consenting to sexual penetration. The remarkably similar accounts of multiple women, who said that Cosby gave them pills that rendered them unconscious or semi-conscious and then penetrated them, tended to disclose Cosby’s signature method, which showed his ", " to penetrate Constand without consent in that instance—as distinct from a mere propensity to commit sexual assault.", "Given the bedrock principle of trying defendants only for the charged (and not uncharged) conduct, applying these exceptions is tricky. But it is difficult to imagine a situation more suited for their application than one in which more than fifty women have described a very similar modus operandi in a period spanning five decades.", "More broadly speaking, exceptions to the prior-bad-acts rule have particular significance in the #MeToo era. Beginning with the sheer number of women alleged to be victims of ", ", Charlie Rose, ", ", and countless others, in the course of decades and generations, a basic concept of #MeToo is the power of numbers across time: the difference between a single victim, whose lone account might not be believed, and the choruses of “me too” that make each individual’s account that much more believable. When it comes down to it, #MeToo itself constitutes an evidentiary claim of sorts: what you say happened to you happened to me, too, and so it is more likely that we are both telling the truth.", "That logic may now find a counterpart in evidentiary decisions at trial. And that connection may find more support in the traditional, “", ",” which the Cosby prosecutor pushed but the judge did not invoke. The doctrine of chances reasons that", " evidence of prior bad acts might be relevant enough to introduce at trial on a theory that goes something like, What are the chances that an innocent person would be repeatedly involved in such similar, abnormal circumstances?", "The Cosby case is, in the end, an emblem of #MeToo, not just because it ended in a guilty verdict but because of the exceptional if controversial evidentiary procedure that enabled a chorus of witnesses—witnesses who would generally be excluded—to back up the main complaining witness, which could well have made the difference between a juror having a reasonable doubt and not having it. It remains to be seen how broadly the legal workarounds for uncharged prior misconduct will be construed by trial courts in future sexual-assault cases, ones in which defendants are not alleged to have such a distinctive signature in the commission of their crimes—or so many victims. But, if we do see a robust #MeToo effect on evidence rules in court, it will likely include more, broader attempts by prosecutors to push the limits of using alleged past misconduct to bolster proof of crimes."]},

South\nKorea’s President, Moon\nJae-in,\nwhose parents fled North Korea, is a former human-rights lawyer of\nhumble origins.

So the mere sight of the two\nleaders extending arms as they approached the demilitarized zone was\nheartening. In a richly choreographed opening, Kim stepped across a wide\ncement curb that divides the two nations, shook hands with Moon, then\nescorted him briefly and symbolically back across the curb, into the\nNorth. They both walked into the village of Panmunjom for a day of\ntalks. Both beamed. They were escorted to the Peace House, the venue for\nthe talks, by an honor guard in uniforms from the nineteenth century,\nwhen the Korean Peninsula was unified. The guards carried spears and\nswords—but no guns—on one of the world’s most fortified frontiers.", "It wasn’t the first meeting of the leaders of the two\ncountries, although it was the first visit to the South by a North\nKorean ruler. The meeting provided a rare glimpse of a possible—if not\nyet probable—détente after a year of sometimes breathless escalation,\noccasionally fuelled by Trump’s tweets. He once lambasted Kim as “little\nrocket man.” In January,\nhe tweeted, “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is\non his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food\nstarved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but\nit is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”", "The tenor of exchanges shifted abruptly after Kim reached out to South\nKorea and the U.S. in the New Year, for reasons that are still not completely\nclear. The inter-Korean talks on Friday were intended, in part, to pave\nthe way for a summit between Trump and Kim by the end of June.", "“Things have changed very radically from a few months ago, the\nname-calling and other things,” Trump said at a joint press conference\nwith the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. “Something very dramatic\ncould happen.” Trump praised President Xi Jinping, of China, for his\nhelp in pressuring Pyongyang. He refused to say whether he had already\ncommunicated directly with Kim, but he said talks to determine a venue\nfor a meeting have been narrowed down to two sites. “We’re setting up\nmeetings now,” the President said. “I have a responsibility to see if I\ncan do it.

Wa Lone was a talented and persistent reporter whose intensity was often concealed behind a disarming grin. He joined the paper two years after the country had ended direct censorship of the press—a thrilling time for Burmese reporters, many of whom came to see advocating for press freedom as an extension of their job. Among the stories that Wa Lone covered was the 2014 trial of four Burmese journalists and a news executive accused of disclosing state secrets in a story about an alleged chemical-weapons factory run by the country’s military. When the five were sentenced to ten years of hard labor, Wa Lone and other journalists staged a protest in which they taped their mouths shut and laid down their cameras.

They contend that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo must have been duped, misled, or manipulated into producing their work.", "Burmese journalists and activists say that the arrests are the latest in a series of escalating attacks on the country’s fledgling free press, a close-knit and cash-strapped community where organizations routinely pool resources.

At one of the hearings I attended, lawyers tried for the second time to submit the story that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo wrote as evidence to prove they were simply doing their jobs as journalists, but were denied by the judge.

Instead of defending the two journalists, he lamented that Myanmar had “lost in the media warfare” regarding the Rohingya to international human-rights groups and journalists with more “money and experts.” He claimed that many Rohingya had been told they could find a better life abroad if they fled to Bangladesh. He floated the idea of performing DNA tests on women who allege to have been raped by soldiers. When I asked him about the charges against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, he said that he felt bad for them, but there was nothing the government could do but let the judicial process play out. “We all have to abide by a law as long as it is in place,” he said.", "During my trip, I met Wa Lone’s wife at a Thai restaurant near the offices of the ", ", where she works in sales.

She realized that everyone was staring at her and her toddler—her photo had been distributed on social media. She said that she was fiercely proud of her husband. “I don’t care because my husband was revealing the truth,” she told me. “I am sorry that this has happened to him because he revealed the truth.”"]},

The\ngovernment could file antitrust lawsuits to try to restrict certain\nparts of Amazon’s business, or block its attempts to merge with other\ncompanies.

Last year, when the Justice\nDepartment indicated that it might not allow A.T. & T.’s merger with\nTime Warner, the owner of CNN, to go forward, news reports suggested\nthat Trump had threatened to block the deal as a punishment for CNN’s\nunfavorable coverage of him.

Ortega initially rose to power after the 1979 Sandinista revolution, when he was known as a Marxist firebrand, and he served as the country’s strongman President until 1990, when he ceded power after losing elections. He returned to the Presidency, in 2006, after dropping his Marxist tag, allying himself with former politicos and enemies that included Nicaragua’s corporate class and its archconservative Catholic archbishop, and declaring himself a belated follower of Jesus Christ. In the years since, Ortega and his wife have steadily consolidated their power, eliminating their opponents through a canny combination of economic co-option and, when necessary, outright repression.", "In addition to the executive branch of government, Ortega and Murillo dominate Nicaragua’s Congress and judiciary. The couple’s children, in turn, run the family’s business empire via a web of public-relations firms and media companies that functions as the government’s communications department. The Ortega-Murillo regime, in other words, exists in an echo chamber.", "There are many historical ironies to be found in Nicaragua’s crisis, not least the fact that, forty years ago, Ortega was a young revolutionary who convinced many Nicaraguans (and news consumers around the world) that he was part of a righteous campaign against Somoza, whose father and brother had previously ruled the country in a dynastic reign that stretched back to 1933. The group Ortega headed, called the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, or F.S.L.N., was a guerrilla army, inspired and supported by ", " in Cuba. Upon seizing power, the Sandinistas immediately aligned themselves with the Soviet Union and embarked on an effort to help bring other guerrillas to power in El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries. While Ronald Reagan was President, Nicaragua became a front in the Cold War, which, eventually, thanks to the C.I.A.-backed Contra war against Ortega’s regime, led to the economic devastation of Nicaragua and the collapse of the Sandinistas’ hold on power.", "Another irony is the fact that, just as it was at the end of the Somoza regime, the leading voices of dissent and custodians of press freedom in Nicaragua are the handful of media outlets owned by the Chamorro family. It was the January, 1978, assassination of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, the owner and editor of the country’s main newspaper, ", ", that sparked the anti-Somoza insurrection. Chamorro’s widow, Violeta, was a member of the original Sandinista group that took power after Somoza’s overthrow. But she joined the opposition to Ortega after he turned the government into a Marxist regime. And when he lost power, in 1990, it was Violeta who succeeded him.", "Today, ", " remains a Chamorro family property, and it is the only daily newspaper in the country that stands in opposition to the government. Arguably the only other independent Nicaraguan media outlet of note is Confidencial, an online publication whose small team of reporters has taken on the Ortega government with uncommon valor. The editor-in-chief of Confidencial is Carlos Fernando Chamorro—one of the sons of Pedro Joaquín and Violeta Chamorro. Last week, in a parallel to the Somoza-era closure and censure of ", ", Confidencial declared that its Web site had been the target of a cyberattack and taken down for a crucial number of hours during the protests; to its staff, there seemed little doubt that Ortega’s people were behind the sabotage. “In the protests forty years ago, when Somoza", " cracked down on the press, the ‘journalism of the catacombs’ was born—people would read the news in church courtyards,” Carlos told me this week. “Now, thanks to social media, the people have defeated the censors and the attempts to create an official version of events. Once again, journalists are on the front lines.”", "It can seem as if the cast of the country’s current political drama is the same one that took part in the 1979 uprising, with the players simply inhabiting different roles. In the nineteen-seventies, at the time of his murder, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro’s assistant was a young woman named Rosario Murillo—Ortega’s future wife and the country’s current Vice-President. After the overthrow of Somoza, a young writer named Sergio Ramírez Mercado served as Ortega’s Vice-President for five years. Ramírez eventually broke with Ortega, and, at the height of last week’s riots, Ramírez, now the undisputed grand old man of Nicaraguan letters, was in Madrid to receive the prestigious Cervantes Prize for his lifetime of literary output. During the ceremony, Ramírez dedicated the prize, which was bestowed upon him by King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, “to the memory of the protesters being assassinated in the streets.”", "Part of what makes the recent protests in Nicaragua so notable is that, amid a collapse of the political left across Latin America that is under way, Ortega was beginning to look like the Great Survivor.

This is an outcome that he and Murillo did not expect, and they may not yet believe it to be a real possibility. In their televised appearances over the past week, Ortega and Murillo have been shown in safe settings in the Presidential complex, surrounded by a handful of loyal ministers and generals. They have worn the mild and uncomprehending expressions of people who seem genuinely unaware of the reality outside their privileged circle of influence. They have reminded me of ", ", who believed themselves to be the anointed custodians of the destiny of the Romanian people until that fateful evening in December, 1989, when the cheers of a crowd turned to boos, and would not stop. The look of incomprehension, and then terrified awareness, on the Ceaușescus’ faces as the booing grew more audible was the moment at which their dictatorship ended. Within a few days of that speech, the Ceașescus were shot to death by a hastily convened firing squad. As in so many violent overthrows in history, the men who executed them had been regime loyalists—outwardly, at least."]},

This year’s Cleveland Cavaliers, assembled on the fly, midseason, in the heat of a crazily busy N.B.A. trade deadline, stand among the least coherent and least experienced groups he’s played with. And still, thanks almost totally to James, they survived, by the smallest of margins, their first-round playoff series, against the Indiana Pacers. At this point, we’ve seen every trick James has to offer; the continuing shock is just that he’s been at it so long, and looks ready, for the foreseeable future, to keep going. (Up next: ", ", perennially one of James’s punching bags.) But, this year, that shock has been accompanied, for me, by another: for the first time, I can imagine what the league might look like after he leaves.", "In the past few years, the N.B.A. has enjoyed an especially impressive influx of young talent at just about every position, yielding a league whose competitive balance has tipped, this season most pointedly, toward young legs and away, ever so slightly, from veteran experience. This year’s contest for Rookie of the Year took on outsize importance, probably because fans saw in the main combatants—Ben Simmons, the nearly seven-feet-tall and yet somehow Houdini-ish point guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, and Donovan Mitchell, the joyous gunslinger, built and wired a bit like a tank, who recently led the Utah Jazz past the Oklahoma City Thunder—a pair of players that might dominate the league for years. Meanwhile, an older group of big names once known as the “Banana Boat” crew, ", " for James, is sliding out of the spotlight: Carmelo Anthony was a total liability, floating airballs like languid paper planes, in the Thunder’s series loss against the Jazz; Dwyane Wade, of the Miami Heat, who lost in the first round to Simmons’s Sixers, mustered the occasional heroic quarter, but more often looked, in the droop of his eyelids and slight limp in his gait, like Bruce Willis toward the end of a “Die Hard” ordeal. Only Chris Paul, from that banana bunch, has successfully reinvented himself, as a Stradivarian second fiddle for James Harden in Houston.", "There’s something eerie about the way a new generation simultaneously eclipses and echoes the one that came before it. On the ", " of “Mad Men,” one of the better plotlines spun around a character named Bob Benson, initially unplaceable and so enigmatically talented, who resembled and, by implication, threatened to replace, Don Draper. That kind of uncanny mimicry helps explain the growing enthusiasm for Simmons, who, during the playoffs, has become LeBron’s Bob Benson, and my favorite player to watch. Simmons is tall and imposing; he can muscle into the paint but is most effective as a passer and playmaker—more incredible, on the court, as an intelligence than as a body. Watching the Sixers’ first-round contest against Wade’s older and more rugged Heat, I thought of LeBron’s 2007 series against the Detroit Pistons, who were then the Eastern Conference’s reigning juggernaut. In that series’ final game, James unspooled a performance for the history books—or at least the better YouTube channels, if that’s how we’re doing things from now on—", ". It was a confirmation that James’s previous intimations of greatness were no fluke. Similarly, in Simmons’s last game against the Heat, his already formidable control seemed all but complete. During one possession in the third quarter, he loped up-floor, typically unbothered, then, from the three-point line, with an underhand flick of the wrist, lobbed the ball in a tight ellipse toward the basket, where his extraterrestrially dextrous teammate Joel Embiid was already airborne and available to flush it home. This is the sort of casual virtuosity we have come to expect from James, and, for that reason, it was almost reassuring: the game has surely changed, and even its greatest personnel will fall away, but here we have something to look forward to down the road.", "Now Simmons, Embiid, and the Sixers face another youth-fuelled unit in the Boston Celtics. After losing Kyrie Irving to injury—at twenty-six, Irving’s pretty young himself—the Celtics have relied on the fresh-faced tandem of Jayson Tatum, a rookie, and Jaylen Brown, a second-year player. Neither Tatum nor Brown has as obvious a forebear as Simmons has in James, but their self-possession in the postseason has been just as impressive. Brown recently became Boston’s latest victim to injury, and his load has been picked up, in part, by the twenty-four-year-old guard Terry Rozier, whose renown is so new that one of his opponents in the last round pretended ", ". Already, the Celtics have offered a stouter challenge for the Sixers than the Heat did. Last night, on the way to a 117–101 victory in the first game of the series, they used their uncommon athleticism to chase Philly’s sharpshooters—J. J. Redick, Ersan Ilyasova, and Dario Šarić—away from the three-point line, and out of the rhythm that they’d established against Miami. In order to overcome them, Simmons will have to draw on powers not unlike those displayed by LeBron against the Pacers—or, at least, I hope so."]},

I was fascinated to read, in Jonathan Abrams’s book “", ",” that when Kevin Garnett was a tall, slender thirteen-year-old, he would spend all his free time at his local basketball court in Greenville, South Carolina. The police would have to chase him out at night, and he would arrive with a ball before dawn. But, if the playground was a refuge, it was also a theatre of cruelty where a six-foot-four, three-hundred-pound player nicknamed Bear would dominate him verbally and physically. “I’ve got your mind in my pocket,” he would yell at Garnett after scoring on him. “I own you.” Even after Garnett outgrew his tormentor in height, even when he showed clear signs of becoming a star, the dynamic persisted. “Garnett did not verbally retaliate,” Abrams writes. “He maintained a straight face and returned daily.” Was this masochism or fortitude?", "Garnett is now retired, and he was once one of the most ferociously competitive, trash-talking players that the league had ever seen. He is a direct antecedent of what are now called ", "—big men who can dribble, pass, protect the rim, and shoot the three—but his most lasting legacy on the court may be his habit of knocking away the jump shots that opponents shoot after a whistle. One sees this all the time in today’s N.B.A.—a player shoots after the whistle just to get a stroke in, to see the ball go in the hoop, and an opponent expends considerable energy to rise up and swat it away before the ball can go in. It’s a bit of ritualized psychological warfare, as if to deprive the opponent of every possible satisfaction. “I’ve got your mind in my pocket. I own you.”", "In my town of New Orleans, I’ve been closely watching the Pelicans star Anthony Davis, who, though he never rode the bench in the special-cases lounge, is nevertheless a kind of project. In spite of the fact that he was a blue-chip recruit out of high school, played basketball at Kentucky, where he won a national championship and was named most outstanding player of the N.C.A.A. tournament; was the No. 1 pick of the 2012 draft; and then played on the 2012 Olympic team (which won gold, and where he was the youngest player)—in spite of all this, for most of his career, Davis has been discussed in terms of potential. Even when he began to post impressive numbers, and made the All-Star team for the first time, in 2014 (as the replacement for an injured Kobe Bryant), the talk of the present was always accompanied by speculation about what was to come. As recently as this past December, ESPN’s ", " wrote, “Davis is still an ascending, transcendent talent, a size and skill set from the future plopped into the present.”", "Some of this sense of anticipation regarding Davis is owing to the fact that the idea of growth is fundamental to his story. As Vinay Mullick, the former athletic director of Perspectives, the small charter school that Davis attended in Chicago, put it to me, “Sophomore year he was six feet one, very thin, very long. He wasn’t thrown onto the national stage until he was practically a twelfth grader. There were times when he didn’t think he would get looks. He would tell me, ‘I don’t know if basketball is going to work out for me.’ He had an uncharacteristically long period of innocence. He was six-ten by the time he graduated. You’re not going to see that again. The story of growth.”", "Even though Davis has a height and wingspan unlike almost any other human—Wojnarowski referred to his “condor arms,” but why not go all the way and call them pelican wings?—he is somebody who young people can hope to be. He was once just like us, a six-foot-one sophomore whose fantastical dreams of basketball glory were dying. And look what happened!", "The era of speculating on Davis’s upside has recently been replaced by a sense of astonishment at the present. Among the bevy of statistics generated by the Pelicans’ Game 4 sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers: Davis has now scored a total of two hundred and fifty-eight points in his first eight playoff games. “Only Michael Jordan (283) and LeBron James (266) have scored more points in their first eight playoff", " games over the last 40 years,” according to NBA.com. Also, Davis’s Game 4 totals of forty-seven points, ten rebounds, and three blocks are the most in a playoff game since Hakeem Olajuwon, who scored forty-nine points in 1987, in a game that went to double overtime.", "Davis’s impact is just as substantial on defense. He was the most outstanding player when Kentucky won the N.C.A.A. championship, based almost entirely on his defense and rebounding. His length and his ability to move his feet were essential to the Pelicans’ strategy of containing Portland’s explosive guards. On offense, he exerts a gravitational pull wherever he is, inside or outside, and perhaps most of all when rolling to the basket off a pick-and-roll. There is something almost dreamy about the way he plays—things that should be out of reach are suddenly within his grasp.", "I once sat with Davis along the baseline of the Smoothie King Center, the Pelicans’ arena, after practice. It was a few days after his twenty-first birthday, in March, 2014. He gazed out onto the court, where a few of his teammates were still taking shots, while I peppered him with banal questions to which he gave equally pro-forma answers. I was sufficiently focussed on him that I had no idea a ball was careening toward my face. I only learned of it when, with frog-tongue speed, his hand reached out across the empty seat between us and caught the basketball an inch or so from my cheek. He held it for a split second, then tossed the ball back onto the court. His hand retracted back onto his lap. By the time I turned to thank him, he was again looking away.", "Back in 2014, his coaches were working on his moves in what they called “the Malone Zone.”", "“As in Moses?” I asked.", "“As in Karl,” they said.", "“But Davis doesn’t move at all like Karl Malone.”", "They explained that the space at the elbow, just outside the key, was where Karl Malone had done his work, and that was where they wanted Davis, because once you turned to face the basket the defense could no longer touch you. The idea was to save Davis from undue banging in the post against sturdier players. Head fakes, drives to the baseline, spins back to the middle, jump hooks, short jumpers—that was the plan. Most of all, Davis was ideal for that staple of the N.B.A. offense, the pick-and-roll. Davis has since moved his game both closer to the basket and farther out—he has become one of the league’s best finishers on the pick-and-roll, but he also takes the occasional three and can put the ball on the floor for pull-up jumpers. He is an astonishingly unique player, yet it’s a strange irony of the N.B.A. that he is part of a crop of such players, a herd of unicorns—Joel Embiid, ", ", ", ", Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokić, along with his teammate DeMarcus Cousins.", "Last year, I called the Kentucky coach John Calipari for insight into the new, modern big man in the N.B.A., because he seems to have coached so many of them—Cousins, Davis, Towns, all of whom work both inside and on the perimeter in ways that would have been unfathomable seven years ago. Calipari was an agreeable, engaged conversationalist who referred to his star big men by their first names with such evident pride, even a kind of adoration, that I started to feel as though I were in the presence of a very high-end florist, walking me through his inventory, alluding lovingly to the gorgeous stalks surrounding him. I could imagine him talking like this in the living room of a gigantic high-school student who was a year away from becoming a multimillionaire—someone like DeMarcus, Anthony, and Karl-Anthony. But his message, to my surprise, was that he was, in a sense, the unicorn deprogrammer.", "“No one wants to be center now,” he said. “You can’t even put ‘C’ next to their name in the program. I have to say power forward, wing, strong forward. They think being known as a center limits you. But you want to be an All-Star? Do you want to get paid? You have to master the game seven feet and in. You have to get tough around the basket and learn to fight with two hands. You have to go get forty [points] and twenty [rebounds]. What did Karl do the other night? Thirty-three and nineteen! Anthony and DeMarcus didn’t care about shots. Anthony took the fourth most shots; DeMarcus probably took the third or fourth most shots. Just because you are not shooting doesn’t mean anything.” Cousins was picked fifth in the draft, he noted, and Davis was picked first. “Even Skal [Labissière], who we tried to force stuff on that he wasn’t capable of getting, we tried to say, ‘You have to get tougher around the basket.’ Anthony and DeMarcus and Karl all got it. By the end of the year they were like, ‘Screw you, you are not bullying me—I am bullying you!’ ”", "I asked him what drills he used in order to work on these skills. Most of what he described involved playing with a reduced-size rim to create more rebounds. One in particular stood out—two guys set up beside a reduced rim, a coach shoots, and whoever doesn’t get the rebound has to", " run. “It’s a scrum. It’s like a bone that is thrown into a pack of dogs. Are you hungry? For some guys, it starts caving them in. They have got to be able to look at themselves in the mirror and say, ‘Man, I have got to change.’ ” We ended the chat with a riff about longevity. “Big guys last longer,” he said. “The guys we had might get a fourth contract. I don’t know why, but, historically, if there was anyone playing late in their careers, they were big guys. The six-five guys: they were lucky if they played until they were thirty-three.”", "I am six feet five and a half, and I played basketball continuously from seventh grade through the four years of Division III college. I never really transcended being a project. The projects never stop searching for redemption. Dedication and hard work are always extolled in sports as ", ", which is true, but it masks the degree to which these activities can be a drug. Garnett bouncing his ball on a dirt road on the way to the court before dawn could be a parable of commitment to the game, or it could be an example of a strange ritual of self-abuse in which he was going to be alone with the ball and the hoop in a place where he had been humiliated in public twelve hours earlier. Perhaps basketball pain was itself the attraction, a means of obliterating another kind of pain. You never hear the phrase “basketball junkie” anymore; it sounds too unhealthy. But there is something compulsive about filling an empty hole over and over, the repetition like some kind of homeopathic cure.", "Now I am fifty-two, still an avid player. Being so invested in basketball at my age may seem childish, but there is a certain dignity in being the grumpy, irrationally competitive old guy on the court. Yet even now there will invariably be moments when someone half my age gives me tips—“Don’t bring the ball down!”—or makes noises of encouragement that seem almost paternal, as though I am still some foal who, having finally managed to take four steps in a row without falling down, might possibly live up to his potential.", "The Anthony Davis that I have witnessed this season seems to be someone who has changed in ways that go beyond his skills on the court. In a November game against the Timberwolves and Karl-Anthony Towns, Davis scored seventeen points before the end of the first half, and then threw a tantrum about a foul call and was tossed from the game. DeMarcus Cousins had to run over and wrap his burly arms around Davis to calm him, a role reversal that was rather disturbing, as though the whole arena had just witnessed their parent lose his temper.", "On another occasion, after a come-from-behind win against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Davis took a long time coming out of the shower. I wandered over to the visitors’ locker room and witnessed Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and Carmelo Anthony in a meeting, all of them draped in white towels. It was like a scene from the Roman Senate. I joined the gaggle of press in the center of the room, all looking down at their phones like frightened birds, waiting for the green light to talk to the players and eavesdropping frantically. The only word I could make out was “Shots.”", "Back in the Pelicans’ locker room, everyone was gone, except for members of the press who were still waiting for the star. Davis at last strode into the room—a man in a hurry. “Let’s talk,” he said. He took questions, and, as he had all season, his whole career, really, he parroted the theme of how the most important thing was winning. This time, like many others, he had played almost the whole game.", "“Did you get tired?” I asked.", "He turned to me, looked me straight in the eye, as though it were a question that offended him, and said, “No.”"]},

Moments later, the lead car is engulfed in flame and billowing black smoke. The doors of the second car open, and four figures exit and start to dash forward. A voice offscreen reads out coördinates in English. A wall of flame engulfs the four. The control room erupts into claps. “Yes! Yes!” a voice shouts in accented English. “Thank you! Good hit. Super!”", "The tapes, shot on April 19th, are rare footage of what Saudi Arabia claims are air strikes carried out as part of its war on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Days after the video’s release, Houthi leaders announced that the strike had killed Saleh al-Sammad, the leader of its Supreme Political Council. Since March, 2015, Riyadh has led a coalition of nine Arab and African countries attacking the Houthis in Yemen. The United States and United Kingdom are providing the Saudi-led coalition with targeting tools, logistical support, and weaponry. About fifty U.S. military advisers are in Saudi Arabia helping with the effort. A Pentagon spokesman said that American military forces did not participate in the strike shown in the videos.", "Sammad’s death comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran as President Trump plans to announce whether the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement on May 12th. The war in Yemen, a proxy battle between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia on one side and Iran on the other, has sparked what the U.N. calls the ", ". A former teacher, Sammad was the most important civilian leader in the Houthi movement. The Saudis put him in second place on their most-wanted list, offering twenty million dollars for his capture. He was seen as a relatively moderate force in the Houthi high command, and reportedly supported the secret peace talks that the Houthis have been conducting with the Saudis in Oman. But he was also known for his extreme rhetoric: a few weeks before his death, he threatened additional Houthi ballistic-missile attacks on Saudi territory.", "On Sunday, ", ", President Trump’s ", ", was in Saudi Arabia for talks with the Saudi foreign minister. Pompeo reaffirmed the U.S. policy that “a political solution is the only way to advance long-term stability in Yemen and end the suffering,” and that groups such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s local affiliates have flourished in the vacuum created by the war. But Pompeo blamed Iran for supplying the Houthis with weapons.", "On Twitter, members of the Saudi royal family celebrated Sammad’s killing and touted it as a success for the country’s crown prince and de-facto ruler, ", ", who recently toured Washington and Los Angeles to curry support from the Trump Administration. But the effect of the strike might be to push the Houthis further from the negotiating table. Sammad’s replacement, Mahdi al-Mashat, a politician in his thirties, has demanded all-out war with Saudi Arabia. Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst at Chatham House, said that the strike would reduce the interest of the group’s over-all leader, Abdelmalik al-Houthi, in peace talks. “What it does do is take someone who thought dealmaking was a way of ending the war and replace him with someone more bellicose,” Salisbury told me. “You get into a position where all the voices that Abdulmalik hears are all the hard-liners, the people who are benefitting the most from the war.”", "Shireen al-Adeimi, a Yemeni analyst and doctoral student at Harvard, said that the strike sent the wrong message. “It’s an assassination,” she said. “Any group that assassinates political leaders gives a strong message that they don’t want peace talks. Imagine if the Houthis had sent missiles to Saudi that killed Mohammed bin Salman.”", "U.S. officials have told me that when the bombing began, three years ago, the Saudis claimed that it would force the Houthis to the negotiating table in six weeks. But, as the campaign has dragged on, ", ", forcing the Houthis to retrench, empowering terrorist groups linked with Al Qaeda in the south, and fomenting widespread resentment in Yemen against the coalition and its Western partners. At least ten thousand civilians have been killed in the strikes, and eight million people are now on the edge of famine.", "The Saudi-led strikes have often hit civilian targets, despite the level of precision shown in the Sammad video. On the same day that the Houthis confirmed Sammad’s death, last week, news emerged that the coalition had bombed a wedding in the northern province of Hajjah, killing at least fifty civilians, mainly women and children. The coalition said that it was “investigating” the Hajjah attack. While videos of Sammad’s demise were released, the coalition declined to say which nation was responsible for the Hajjah strike.", "The location of Sammad’s death, Hodeidah, is also fuelling concern. The port is a lifeline to the north of Yemen, and where the majority of humanitarian aid arrives to the country. Twenty-two million of the Yemen’s twenty-seven million people are in need of humanitarian assistance or protection. The Saudi-led coalition has intermittently blockaded supplies coming into Hodeidah and floated the idea of attacking the port. The United", " States, among others, warned the coalition off when it planned a full-scale assault on the port, in late 2016 and early 2017.", "Now, Yemenis fear that the assault on Hodeidah is once again in the offing. There are reports that a Saudi-backed group of Yemeni fighters is gathering for an offensive near the city, and U.N. officials are warning of the growing probability of an assault. The government of the U.A.E. has committed not to strike Hodeidah, but U.S. officials say that they cannot be sure the Emiratis will abide by their promise. Aid groups and analysts warn of a potential bloodbath. “The losses are not going to be Houthis. It’s going to be mostly civilians,” Sama’a al-Hamdani, a Yemeni political analyst and fellow with the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, told me. “It’s one of those scenarios where I think a massacre would have to happen for them to push through.”", "On Wednesday, thousands of armed pro-Houthi protesters gathered in Hodeidah in a “rifles march,” a show of force as much as a political protest after Sammad’s death. Houthis also began a military recruiting drive in the city. Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s humanitarian-policy lead, recently returned from a trip to Yemen. “If the offensive to capture Hodeidah progresses, everybody will lose,” Paul told me. “Prices will go up everywhere, not just in the north.” The result, he told me, would be “more starvation, more preventable disease brought on by malnutrition.”", "Other analysts predicted that the Saudis will mount no ground offensive but will continue their air strikes, and the conflict—and Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe—will grind on. Hamdani, the political analyst, said that the one thing that Sammad’s death failed to do was blunt the Houthis’ resolve. She argued that it would be impossible for the Saudis to win an outright military victory against the Houthis, who could wage a guerrilla war from remote areas for years. “They’re fighters,” Hamdani told me. “Are they better than the Yemeni military? Yes. Are they able to kick out Al Qaeda from the areas that they’re in? Yes. Do they fight to death? Yes. This is the scary part of it. You’re fighting with a machine that refuses to give up, in a sense.”"]},

When Remnick asked Comey to comment on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s silence after Trump fired him, Comey said that the question that they needed to ask themselves is, “ ‘What am I going to tell my grandchildren?’ ”", "Toward the end of the interview, Remnick asked Comey if he believed Trump was a bigot. “I don’t think that I can pronounce that,” he said.

Even\nconservative politicians are warming to the idea. John Boehner, the\nsixty-eight-year-old former Speaker of the House, who in 2011 said he\nwas “unalterably opposed” to the legalization of marijuana, recently\nmade news by announcing that he was joining the board of Acreage\nHoldings, which distributes cannabis across eleven states. His “thinking\non cannabis” had “evolved,” ", ".", "In Louisville, the week before the field trip, there had been a lecture\nat Balfour by Joseph Cohen, D.O., the founder of Holos Health, which advises people on medical cannabis.\nThe talk drew an overflow crowd of two hundred, with people standing\nagainst walls and spilling into the hallway. “The first thing older\nfolks say when they enter our office is, ‘I don’t want to get high,’ ”\nCohen said. He explained that there are two primary compounds in\ncannabis: THC, which is psychoactive, and CBD, which is not. “So CBD is\na great solution for elders,” he said. “I took a little CBD before this\ntalk, to make sure I stay calm.”", "Cohen is seventy-one, with a long, gray ponytail and a beard. He\nrecommends CBD for age-related diseases, such as Parkinson’s, dementia,\nosteoarthritis, and chronic inflammation. “CBD has twenty times the\nanti-inflammatory power of aspirin and two times the power of steroids,”\nhe said. Since cannabis is federally illegal, none of his\nclaims—or those made by any other clinician—can be supported by\ndouble-blind studies on humans, the gold standard in medical science.\nBut in February a peer-reviewed study of almost three thousand patients\nin Israel, the first of its kind, showed that cannabis can be safe and\neffective for seniors, and lead to decreased use of pharmaceuticals,\nincluding opioids.

He explained that the body makes\nendocannabinoids—chemicals similar to THC and CBD—which lock onto\nreceptors found throughout the body, especially in the brain. “Receptors\nare not found in the body because there is a plant out there that will\ntrigger them,” Raphael Mechoulam, the Israeli biochemist who discovered\nTHC, in 1964, said. “Receptors are present because the body makes\ncompounds that activate them.”", "Two major groups of seniors are turning to cannabis. The first, like the\nwomen on the field trip, have never tried marijuana and are drawn to its\nalleged health benefits. The second are boomers who “smoked dope” in the\nsixties and seventies, giving it up when they became focussed on careers\nor raising kids. An attorney I know in Los Angeles, who didn’t want his\nname disclosed, recently returned to the drug after developing acute\npain in his joints. At seventy-one, he was diagnosed with polymyalgia\nrheumatica, an inflammatory autoimmune disease. His doctor put him on\nprednisone. This decreased the pain but had unpleasant side effects,\nincluding insomnia, and required him to give up his passion for fine\nwine.", "When he began hearing that CBD was anti-inflammatory, he secured a\nmedical license and went to a dispensary. “I was shocked,” he said. “The\nlast time I was smoking grass, you bought a baggie filled with sticks\nand seeds", " from some shady character.” At the dispensary, he saw products\nlabelled with the names of strains and the percentages of THC and CBD\nthey contained. “The twenty-something budtenders became my sommeliers,”\nhe said. “They’re as knowledgeable as wine stewards at the best L.A.\nrestaurants.” He found a strain, Bubba Kush, that helped him sleep, and\ngradually started experimenting with other strains, finding new and\nenjoyable effects.", "Another boomer I talked to is a former high-school art teacher, in\nBoulder, who wanted to try CBD for anxiety. After receiving strains with\nhigh amounts of the chemical from her daughter, in Seattle—Colorado\ngrowers were breeding the plant to increase THC instead—she started\nmaking her own oil from the plant. Her kitchen looked like a scene from\n“Breaking Bad.” (“Breaking Bud,” as she put it. ) The oil relieved her\nanxiety, and she shared it with friends, asking them to report their\nresponses. One said it improved her arthritis; another said it helped\nwith acid reflux. About forty per cent felt no effect. This confirmed\nwhat’s generally acknowledged: people respond differently to the same\nsample of cannabis. “You have to be your own chemistry set,” she said.", "Cannabis’s appeal isn’t universal; it's still stigmatized in some communities. Sue Taylor, a seventy-year-old retired Catholic-school\nprincipal, never smoked pot while raising her three sons, and many in\nher Oakland community, she said, saw it as “a hardcore drug that got\ntheir young men in jail.” The incarceration rate of African-Americans\nfor drug charges is nearly six times that of whites, despite a similar\nrate of drug use. When one of Taylor’s sons called to say he was\nstudying at Oaksterdam University, which offers training for the\ncannabis industry, she flew to Oakland to “save him from drugs.” But she\nwas persuaded of pot’s medical value after doing some research, visiting\nsenior care homes, and working at Harborside dispensary, where she saw\npatients’ conditions improve after cannabis treatment.", "Taylor is now a commissioner on aging in Alameda County, and said she is one of two people in California certified to\ntrain physicians and nurses in medical cannabis. She speaks at churches\nand senior centers. “In the beginning, they’ll sit, frowning, with their\narms folded across their chests,” she said. “I tell them I’m not trying\nto convince anyone, I’m only here to educate you about the\nhealth benefits.” This summer, she plans to open iCANN Berkeley, a\ndispensary and wellness center, in a historically black neighborhood,\nwhich will cater to seniors. “Seniors are the most vulnerable\npopulation we have,” she said. “People think they can give them a pill\nand not worry if it’s gonna kill them because they’re almost dead\nanyway.”", "For Taylor, polypharmacy—the prescription of multiple drugs—is an urgent\nissue. “Most seniors we see are taking fifteen to twenty-six pills a\nday,” she said, adding that this can start with something as simple as a consultation for high blood pressure. “The\ndoctor gives them a pill for it, which causes the thyroid to go out. The\nthyroid pill causes the liver to go out. The liver pill makes your\npancreas go out of whack, and the list goes on,” she said. “Most\nimportant, the patients are not getting better. They’re getting worse\nand worse.”", "Six months after the Balfour field trip, I contacted some of the\nparticipants to see how they’d fared. Leslie Brown, who suffers from\ninsomnia, said she tried one pill. “I gave it a shot and it didn’t help\nme sleep, so I didn’t take any more,” she said. Her husband, Ira, who\nhas neuropathy, said he tried a gummy bear two times and “it had no\neffect.” When I reported this to Cohen, he said that “people have to\nrealize that you sometimes you have to wake up your receptors. You have\nto try it several times. And not everything works for everybody,\nanyway.” When I told this to Leslie, she was silent. “Maybe I’ll try it\nagain,” she said. “It would be nice to have a good night’s sleep.”"]},

In the early days of the Internet and satellite cable, English football was still a fairly provincial game, typified by a brawling, pugnacious spirit. Wenger, who had managed in Monaco and Nagoya, Japan, brought new ideas about how the game should be played, and what kinds of players the club should pursue and develop. There was a meticulousness in his approach that extended to how the players took care of themselves. “I think in England you eat too much sugar and meat and not enough vegetables,” ", ". At the time, players were more accustomed to pre-match chocolate bars than to individually tailored nutritional regimes or post-game massages. If Wenger’s players insisted on taking sugar with their coffee, he reportedly recommended ", " to insure that all of the granules properly dissolved.", "Last week, Wenger announced that he would be stepping down from his position at the end of this season, after twenty-two years in charge of Arsenal. It was partly seen as a face-saving measure; fans and club executives alike have been wondering whether Wenger’s innovations had run their course. It was an impressive course: Wenger is one of the most successful managers in English history—his teams have won three league titles and seven FA Cups. In 2003 and 2004, his team captivated the soccer world by going on a forty-nine-match unbeaten streak, becoming the first English team since the eighteen-eighties to go through an entire season without a loss. But statistics and trophy tallies don’t quite capture his influence.", "A year before Wenger got the job, a European Court decision, which became known as the “Bosman ruling,” radically changed soccer’s labor market. Before Bosman, English soccer still allowed quotas on the number of foreigners a team could field, and “free agents” of any nationality who were out of contract still belonged to their clubs, unable to sign elsewhere. Bosman changed all this, and Wenger anticipated what these changes meant, helping accelerate soccer’s embrace of globalization. Arsenal became famous for finding young talent all over the planet—particularly throughout Africa and the African diaspora. When, in 2005, Arsenal fielded an entire squad, including substitutes, without an Englishman, it didn’t seem mercenary so much as evolutionary.", "The following year, an Arsenal lineup featured eleven players from eleven different countries. At the team’s peak, Arsenal’s players shared an ethos that was free-flowing, flexible, and communal, radically changing the reputation of a club once associated with a hard-nosed pragmatism. This is another way of saying that Wenger’s teams could be cool, in a way that translated beyond borders, language, and history. His best teams were beloved around the world for their fluid, occasionally gorgeous style. It was as though they were trying to score the prettiest, most elaborate goals possible.", "Over time, many of Wenger’s once zany-seeming ideas about fitness regimens and the global talent pool have been absorbed into the soccer mainstream. He inflected Arsenal with a kind of cosmopolitan marketing cachet, signing exhilarating young players and moving the club from the cozy, ninety-three-year-old Highbury Stadium to the state-of-the-art Emirates Stadium, in 2006. These maneuvers have been widely imitated. But Wenger’s tendency toward fiscal prudence—last year, Arsenal was the ", "—has left his team lagging behind such rivals as Manchester City, Manchester United, and Chelsea, who luxuriate in the new realities of skyrocketing salaries, king-making agents, and transfer fees. Wenger’s reluctance to dive headlong into the financialization of soccer speaks to a kind of core integrity, as well as a sense of job security; after all, he enjoyed a stellar run turning talented youngsters—Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Cesc Fàbregas—into stars. (The average Premier League manager ", ", so it’s generally better to make moves than to patiently stay the course.)", "Managers are often judged by their ability to impress a personal style—", "—upon their players. Some demand sacrifice, a stifling of solo flair in the name of team pragmatism. Others manage from the heart, offering their players free license to express themselves. Wenger’s teams have always seemed cultured and sophisticated, hard-wired to entertain and delight. “The moral values I’ve learnt in my life I’ve learnt through football,” he once said. “", ", to give back to those people who love Arsenal so that they learn moral values from our game and how we behave.”", "But, in recent years, far removed from Arsenal’s glory days, Wenger’s teams have come to seem twinkly and fussy, lacking the cunning and toughness necessary in moments of crisis. At some point during the past few years, his total commitment to the ideals of beautiful play began to feel naïve, as though this were art for art’s sake. It is the fatal side of romance. Would you rather win, or dream your way to oblivion?", "As someone who has rooted against Arsenal for years, I feel safe professing admiration for Wenger now that he is on the way out. The team’s lack of recent success has made it easier to admire his virtues, maybe even sympathize with Arsenal’s coming upheaval. When Alex Ferguson left Manchester United—the club I support—in 2013, after twenty-six years in charge, he left behind a vacuum that will probably", " never adequately be filled. During their tenures, Ferguson and Wenger were living monuments from a different, seemingly pre-modern era, when it seemed like strong-willed individuals could resist or at least harness the forces of global change.", "On Sunday, Arsenal hosted West Ham, whose current manager, David Moyes, replaced Ferguson at Manchester United. (He lasted just ten months there.) During the match, an air of uncertainty hung over the Emirates crowd. Fans, relieved from conflicted feelings about their club’s greatest-ever manager, could shower Wenger with their full-throated appreciation, but they rarely did. The match was filled with effervescent sequences that amounted to little, reminders of why people felt ambivalence about Wenger in the first place—and reminders, too, of the challenge facing Arsenal’s next boss.", "In the eighty-second minute, with the match tied 1–1, Arsenal’s Welsh midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, curled the ball toward goal, hoping to find the Gabonese forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But Aubameyang—and, more important, the nearest West Ham defender—ducked out of the way, and Ramsey’s ball unexpectedly bounced into the back of the net. A team of meticulous craftsmen, and a fluke goal: it seemed a funny way to start Wenger’s farewell tour. A couple of minutes later, Arsenal attacked again, with more confidence and flair this time, as though they were playing an elegant game of hot potato, and their French forward Alexandre Lacazette fizzed in another goal from a few yards out. Victory safely in hand, Arsenal surged forward one last time, and some nimble footwork from Ramsey resulted in another goal from Lacazette. A dull afternoon had ended with a 4–1 scoreline, and the remaining fans finally sang out: “There’s only one Arsène Wenger.”"]},

By May 12th, President Trump will decide whether to kick it into the abyss. He hates it. “The worst deal I’ve ever seen,” he ", ", in an interview for the 2017 Super Bowl. “It was a deal that should never have been negotiated.” The world’s five other major powers—Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia—were equal parties to the accord. The United Nations Security Council unanimously endorsed it, as did the twenty-eight nations of the European Union. But the United States was the decisive voice during the two years of diplomacy that went into the deal’s signing, in 2015, and it will be decisive in its fate now.", "Trump could kill the deal by deciding not to comply with U.S. obligations—namely, the waiving of sanctions, which was promised in exchange for Iran limiting its controversial nuclear program. The President could also walk away from the deal altogether, even though the five other powers are still wedded to it. His Administration apparently calculates that Iran will stick to the terms, whatever Washington does. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told me otherwise. “If they want to kill the deal, they have that option, but they have to face the consequences,” Zarif said. “It’s dangerous to be arrogant, very dangerous.” For fifteen months, he added, Trump has already tried to sabotage the accord by disrupting normal business with Iran.", "Zarif, who completed his doctorate at the University of Denver’s Josef Korbel School of International Studies, is spending six days in New York; he’s technically on U.N. business, but is also speaking  with members of Congress, the U.S. foreign-policy community, and the media. I met with him three times, and he seemed intent on trying to salvage the accord. “It’s important for Iran to receive the benefits of the agreement,” he said.", "Tehran has three broad choices if Trump opts out, according to Zarif. In the first, Iran could withdraw from the deal, terminate compliance, and resume—even increase—its uranium enrichment, which produces fuel that can be used in either a nuclear-energy program or the world’s deadliest weapon. Despite its vast oil reserves, the country is keen to harness nuclear power, which could diversify energy sources for a burgeoning population, conserve resources for export, and accelerate modern development. “America never should have feared Iran producing a nuclear bomb,” Zarif said. “But we will pursue vigorously our nuclear enrichment.”", "Iran once had the capacity to enrich uranium at twenty per cent, a level that far exceeds the basic needs for an energy program. As is, the deal limits Iran to roughly 3.7-per-cent enrichment. (The U.S., along with the five other major powers, argued that Iran did not need a higher capacity if, as it claimed, it only wanted enriched uranium for nuclear energy.) The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, in the toughest inspections ever imposed on any country, has repeatedly certified Iran’s compliance.", "Iran’s second option exploits a dispute mechanism in the deal, which allows any party to file a formal complaint with a commission established to adjudicate violations. Iran has filed eleven complaints—to Federica Mogherini, the E.U.’s foreign-policy chief, who heads the commission—citing U.S. violations on three different counts, Zarif said. The process allows forty-five days for resolution. “The objective of the process is to bring the United States into compliance,” Zarif said.", "Britain, France, and Germany, the three European powers party to the deal, have already been trying to achieve that objective. Since January, they have brokered quiet negotiations through the State Department to address Trump’s objections but save the accord. Those objections, backed by many in Congress, involve concerns about the scope of inspections, future tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and so-called sunset clauses, which would eventually allow Iran to resume sensitive activities.", "The European effort has reached its final stages, with agreement on most issues except sunset clauses. As part of the effort, the Europeans are also trying to win a guarantee from the White House that it will not impede Iran’s international business—a hard sell, according to European officials. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to press the case further with Trump during his three-day state visit, which begins Monday, diplomats told me. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, due in town on Friday, will follow suit, and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will make her case by phone.", "But Zarif said any compromise that adds new conditions or interpretations was a non-starter. “We don’t condone it, and we don’t believe it’s useful or fruitful or conducive to a better implementation of the [deal], and they know that to be our position,” Zarif said. “The only scenario that we can deal with is for the Europeans to talk to the Trump Administration to start, once and for all, complying with the deal.”", "Iran’s third option is the most drastic: the country could decide to walk away from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or N.P.T., ", " now signed by a hundred and ninety-one nations. The treaty, enacted in 1970, seeks to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and foster the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The crisis surrounding Iran’s program began in 2003, when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that", " Tehran failed to meet its obligations under the N.P.T., specifically in declaring its uranium-enrichment program.", "In Tehran, debate is still intense about which option Iran should choose. “Iran is not a monolith,” Zarif said. But he noted that the public’s mood had shifted over the past year. Distrust is deeper. “The United States has not only failed to implement its side but is even asking for more,” he said. “That’s a very dangerous message to send to the people of Iran, but also to the people of the world—that you should never come to an agreement with the United States, because, at the end of the day, the operating principle for the United States is ‘what’s mine is mine, what’s yours is negotiable.’ ”", "I asked Zarif if there was a prospect, if the deal dies, that Iran would negotiate again with the United States. “Diplomacy never dies,” he told me. “But it doesn’t mean that there is only one avenue for diplomacy, and that is the United States.” Whatever Iran’s final decision, he said, it “won’t be very pleasant to the United States. That I can say. That’s a consensus.”"]},

In the lobby of the town hall is a painting of Karl Marx, not of\nTurkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, whose picture hangs in most\nother Turkish government offices. In early February, a piece of paper\nposted on the building’s outer wall itemized the town’s income,\nexpenditures, and surplus budget, part of which goes to scholarships for\nuniversity students. Displaying the itemized income each year is a\npractice that the local mayor, Fatih Mehmet Maçoğlu, began when he was\nelected, four years ago. Maçoğlu promised the village’s roughly\nthirty-one hundred residents transparency and accountability; publicly\nitemizing the local government’s income was one way to deliver it.", "Soon after this year’s income was posted, a photo of the piece of paper\nwas shared on Twitter—a source of news for many young Turks. Within\nweeks, the obscure village mayor became a grassroots symbol of good\ngovernance in Turkey. When President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan unexpectedly\nannounced this week that Presidential elections would be held in two\nmonths, a full year earlier than planned, citizens took to Twitter and\ncalled for Maçoğlu to run. “Mr. Mayor, for God’s sake, become our\npresidential candidate now that the election date has been announced,\nsave us,” one user wrote.", "Maçoğlu, a forty-nine-year-old former health-care worker and longtime\nleftist activist, played down his sudden popularity. “It is important\nfor a society to think out loud,” he told me over the phone this week.\nAs for a Presidential run, Maçoğlu said that he plans to run for mayor,\neither in Ovacık or elsewhere, but was less direct regarding whom he\nwould support for President. “Ovacık is prepared for these expedited\nelections, and we Ovacık citizens know who to support,” he said, without\nspecifying a candidate.", "Members of Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P,\nwhich dominates Turkey, dismissed Maçoğlu.

Our mayors are\ndoing the same thing,” Alcan told me. “The media is exaggerating because\nof the Communism connection. I’m against Communism because it doesn’t\ngive freedom to religious ideas.”", "Some Turkish leftists dismiss Maçoğlu’s popularity, too. Ahmet Kerim\nGültekin, an anthropologist and a former assistant professor at Munzur\nUniversity, in nearby Tunceli, said that focus on one man fractures\nTurkey’s opposition and draws attention away from uniting against\nErdoğan and his party.", "Communists are a marginal group in\nTurkey—Maçoğlu remains the only mayor to win office under the Communist\nParty banner—and Maçoğlu’s election showed that the A.K.P. is willing to\ntolerate a Communist politician in its midst, because he’s not a threat.\n“It was harmless Communism,” Gültekin said.", "More than fifty thousand people who were accused\nof terrorism in the wake of a failed 2016 coup against Erdoğan’s\ngovernment are awaiting trial.

Maçoğlu, who works in\nthe fields alongside local farmers, plans to open an organic dairy farm\nnext. Since taking office, he has also opened several libraries, made\npublic transportation free, and reduced the cost of the water provided\nby the municipality.

It begins with Il Duce, for context.", "Mussolini called on his followers to believe in an Italy that would be “prosperous because it was self-sufficient and respected because it was feared,” Albright writes. “This was how twentieth-century fascism began: with a magnetic leader exploiting widespread dissatisfaction by promising all things.” Il Duce, who was Italy’s Prime Minister from 1922 until 1943, said that his mission was “to break the bones of the democrats . . . and the sooner the better.” He used the term “", ",” or “drain the swamp.” He had a talent for theatre, Albright notes, and was a poor listener who disliked hearing other people talk.

He convinced millions that he “cared for them deeply when, in fact, he would have willingly sacrificed them all.” Even Winston Churchill was duped, she recalls. In 1935, Churchill described Hitler as highly competent, with “an agreeable manner, a disarming smile, and few have been unaffected by a subtle personal magnetism.” Hitler and Mussolini were different, however, in a pivotal way: Hitler had an ideology—Nazism. Mussolini did not; his appeal was pure nativist populism.", "The United States was not immune to the temptation of Fascism. In 1939, ", ", who led the Nazi-affiliated German American Bund, famously attracted twenty thousand followers to an event at Madison Square Garden, which echoed with shouts of “", ".” (He ended up serving a four-year prison stint for tax evasion.) Senator Joe McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican, was a showman who had “the mentality of a Fascist bully” and “the instincts of a Mussolini,” but lacked the intellect, Albright writes. McCarthy fooled many by using the demagogue’s trick: “repeat a lie often enough and it begins to sound like it must—or at least might—be so.” In 1940, the America First Committee included Nazi sympathizers—and claimed eight hundred thousand members within its first year.", "The premise of Albright’s book is that the Fascism of a century ago was not atypical. “In hindsight, it is tempting to dismiss every Fascist of this era as a thoroughly bad guy or a lunatic, but that is too easy, also dangerous,” she writes. “Fascism is not an exception to humanity, but part of it.” In the early twenty-first century, authoritarian demagoguery and nativist populism are making inroads in Egypt, Hungary, North Korea, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela. It’s part of a global trend. Worldwide, seventy-two nations had limited freedoms and a decline in democratic health according to ", " published in 2017.", "“Anti-democratic leaders are winning democratic elections,” Albright writes, “and some of the world’s savviest politicians are moving closer to tyranny with each passing year.” Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t a full-blown Fascist, but he has “flipped through Stalin’s copy of the totalitarian playbook and underlined passages of interest to call on when convenient.”", "Albright’s linking of the past and the present", " is, at times, weak. “We are not there yet,” she acknowledges, “but these feel like signposts on the road back to an era when Fascism found nourishment and individual tragedies were multiplied millions-fold.” Mussolini’s political strategy, she notes, was to pluck a chicken one feather at a time, so that each squawk will be heard separately “and the whole process is kept as quiet as possible.”", "The future of American politics is the subtext of Albright’s book. “The elephant rampaging through these pages is, of course, Donald Trump,” she writes. He won the Presidency  “because he convinced enough voters in the right states that he was a teller of blunt truths, a masterful negotiator, and an effective champion of American interests. That he is none of those things should disturb our sleep, but there is a larger cause for unease. Trump is the first antidemocratic president in modern U.S. history.”", "There are other worrying signs. ", " index—which factors in due process, individual freedoms, and space for civil society—reduced the United States’ ranking from a full democracy to a “flawed democracy.” In the early nineteen-sixties, more than seventy per cent of Americans told Pew researchers that they had faith in government “most of the time” or “just about always.” In 2016, faith had sunk below twenty per cent. American politics is increasingly defined by contempt rather than a sense of common good.", "“We are becoming disconnected from the ideals that have long inspired and united us,” Albright warns. “It doesn’t take much imagination to conceive of circumstances—another major recession, a corruption scandal, racial unrest, more terror incidents, assassination, a series of natural disasters, or a sudden plunge into an unexpected war—that might trigger a demand for answers that our Constitution, democracy’s manual, is too slow to provide.”", "Albright may have overstated where the United States is right now. She was Bill Clinton’s Secretary of State and campaigned for Hillary. She was never going to support Trump, or like much about him, whatever her ", ". But Albright—who, at eighty, still teaches at Georgetown University—does have serious credibility on the subject. She witnessed the evils of Fascism firsthand, as her book movingly chronicles. And she effectively makes the case: pay more attention to the signals, subtle and strong. A lot more."]},

Hannity maintains that he only talked to Cohen about real estate. According to public records obtained by the ", ", some of which I have also reviewed, Hannity is linked—in many cases, if not all, as an owner—to shell companies that spent at least ninety million dollars in the past decade on more than eight hundred and seventy homes in seven states: some of them mansions, others low-income rentals purchased with support from the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development. One of those states is Georgia, where Hannity, now fifty-six, established his conservative-media bona fides in radio before jumping to television. Among other holdings there, Hannity owns Hampton Place Apartments, a hundred-and-fifty-two-unit development in Perry, a small town in the middle of the state, which I visited on Monday afternoon.", "As I drove south from Atlanta, I called Scott Free, a real-estate broker who has worked the commercial and residential market in the Perry area for three decades. “I thought I knew every owner in Perry and Houston County,” Free told me. “And, at one time, I owned the subdivision that backed up to that very property you’re telling me Hannity owns.” He paused. “Must be a shell entity he’s a part of.” Later, I reviewed the records, which showed that SPMK XVI Hampton L.L.C. bought the nearly seventeen-acre property, in 2014. (SPMK, which is based in Kennesaw, Georgia, combines the initials of Hannity and his children’s first names.) The development’s nineteen apartment buildings each contain eight units with one or two bedrooms. They were built in 1997, along with a clubhouse. A small pool and tennis court were added the following year.", "An eighth grader was walking around the tree-lined complex selling coupon books when I arrived. Planters with flowers hung outside off-white units. There was a communal barbecue smoker, lots of satellite dishes. The lawn appeared to have been freshly mown and the roofs looked recently shingled. The leasing Web site listed three apartments available for rent, which translates to a ninety-eight per cent occupancy rate. Inside the leasing office, I picked up a glossy look book that advertised a fitness center, on-site laundry, the recently resurfaced tennis court, and the proximity to a “grocery center” that includes a Publix supermarket and a Starbucks. Horses pastured nearby. “Where luxury and convenience come together to make your new home,” the brochure read.", "The first resident I spoke to was Amos, a thirty-four-year-old African-American man who described himself as a Democrat and who works for a local soft-drink packaging company. Amos said he’s lived at Hampton Place for a year and a half. Did he know who owns the property? He did not, so I told him. “I don’t know who he is,” Amos said. I told him that Hannity hosts conservative television and radio shows, and that he is close with President Trump. “Uh-oh, that’s not good,” Amos said. He laughed. “But they cut the grass here every weekend, it seems like, so I’m good with that.”", "Next I spoke with Cynthia, an African-American woman who works as a mental-health counsellor and who is also a Democrat. She has lived at Hampton Place for six months. “It’s very well taken care of,” she said. “It’s quiet. When you report something, they usually get on it as soon as possible.” She added, “It’s diverse. The neighbors are friendly. It’s more older people, I’d say, at least in my building.” According to the Atlanta ", ", ", " guaranteed a loan for the property only if Hannity “promised to lease at least three-fourths of the units to elderly people.” When I asked Cynthia about Hannity, she, too, told me she did not know who he was. “I’m fixing to go Google him as soon as I go upstairs,” she said.", "Paul, a Perry native and employee at the nearby Robins Air Force Base, stepped out of a red pickup truck wearing a red hat, black sunglasses, and a T-shirt that read “Make America Give Blood Again.” That was the closest thing to a political slogan that I saw at Hampton Place, where all the bumper stickers advertised honor students, football teams, or Jesus. Paul is white, in his fifties, with two kids. “I just know he’s a TV personality,” he said, of Hannity. “I’m not a big news person,” he added. “I’ve been kind of turned off by the news here lately.” He described Perry as a great place to live: a small, quiet, Southern town. “Calm and cool. Can’t beat it, as far as I’m concerned,” he said. He had lived as far off as Warner Robins, fifteen minutes away, which he described as “way too crowded for me.” As for Hannity’s ownership of Hampton Place, Paul said, “If you can make money and legally make money, I got no problem with it.”", "I spoke to six other residents who also had never heard of Sean Hannity. Yardley, a thirty-year-old African-American Democrat who paints school buses for a living, told me that he watches “local news and some CNN, but I don’t have a problem with", " most Republicans. Nine times out of ten, they’re just doing how they was brought up.” Yardley said that things were well taken care of at Hampton Place, though he didn’t like the new water plan. “You pay based off what the whole building uses,” he said. “I think that’s a pain in the ass. I don’t know if Hannity came up with that.”", "Ed, a ninety-two-year-old retired minister, prison chaplain, and religious author, wore an ", " hat as he took his daily walk around the complex. Ed, who is white, knew who Hannity was. “Wow, that’s something,” he said, when I told him Hannity owned the place. “I had no idea. That blows my mind. I’m sure he has the bucks.” Ed said he didn’t watch TV news, though, preferring Internet radio. “But I think Hannity is one of the best on TV news,” he told me. “Neat to know he’s my landlord.”", "On Monday, Hannity wrote a short article for hannity.com, “", ".” He deemed it “ironic” to be “attacked for investing my personal money in communities that badly need such investment and in which, I am sure, those attacking me have not invested their money.” He also insisted that the investments cited by the ", " were ones that he did not “individually select, control, or know the details about; except that obviously I believe in putting my money to work in communities that otherwise struggle to receive such support.” His real-estate attorney, Christopher Reeves, e-mailed the ", ". “I doubt you would find it very surprising that most people prefer to keep their legal and personal financial issues private,” he wrote. “Mr. Hannity is no different.”"]},

Unlike in similar vehicle attacks—in iconic locations in Berlin, Nice, London, and New York—which have been inspired by the Islamic State, the attacker apparently identified with the so-called incel movement: the “involuntarily celibate” men who profess violent hatred toward the women who have ignored or spurned them.", "His choice of location was also anomalous. The mile-long stretch where the attack took place is on Toronto’s periphery, at the end of a subway line. Twenty years ago, before Toronto’s various  districts merged into a single “megacity,” the area was the administrative seat for the municipality of North York. The neighborhood includes a large library, a public pool, and a high school known for its performing-arts program. In the condominiums that line the street, one can hear Farsi, Korean, Chinese, Russian. The area might boast the highest concentration of bubble-tea establishments in the city. Massive billboards promote local Persian real-estate agents and touring performers from Iran. It’s unclear why the killer chose this area on this particular day. It coincided with no holiday or special event—just lunch hour on the first warm day of spring. Had he wanted to cause greater carnage and terror, he needed only to drive a few more miles down Yonge Street, into the core of the city.", "What was most unusual about the attack, though, was how it ended. As in many other attacks, the moment that the police confronted the suspect was captured on cell-phone video. The videos displayed what, in relative terms, was superhuman restraint by the Canadian police officer. The killer climbs out of his stalled van, as the officer points his service weapon at him. The killer points something black and ambiguous at the officer in return. The officer holds his fire as the man dares him to kill him, to shoot him in the head. The officer doesn’t. The killer then claims to have a gun in his pocket and motions for it. The officer—heroically or recklessly—doesn’t flinch, and says, “I don’t care, get down.” The killer takes a step toward the officer. The officer somehow deduces that the man is bluffing and unarmed. He holsters his weapon and takes out his baton. He then advances toward the killer, who compliantly gets on the ground and allows himself to be cuffed.", "The reaction to this scene by most Torontonians was admiration and awe. There’s nothing Canadians like better than to favorably contrast ourselves against Americans, and we’re familiar with the pattern of American cops gunning down unarmed (and predominantly black) men. We like to see ourselves as more tolerant and reasonable. It’s an old trope, but it persists—especially as civic life in America becomes increasingly antagonistic and cruel. It’s nice to imagine that the police officer exemplifies us Torontonians, us Canadians. But I suspect that many Torontonians who celebrated this video also recall a different one, from the summer of 2013, that showed a confrontation between a Toronto police officer and an eighteen-year-old kid named Sammy Yatim.", "On that July night, Yatim—a Syrian who had immigrated, with his mother, to Toronto five years earlier—boarded a streetcar, and proceeded to behave erratically and menacingly toward the other passengers. He exposed himself and brandished a knife. He didn’t hurt anyone, and by the time police arrived all the other riders had fled the streetcar. The driver cleared out, too, leaving Yatim to face several armed police officers. Repeatedly ordered to drop the knife, Yatim refused. Though he didn’t pose an imminent danger to the officers, one opened fire, discharging nine bullets, eight of which struck Yatim, killing him. At trial, the officer was absolved of second-degree murder and manslaughter but, bizarrely, convicted of attempted murder—notwithstanding the success of the attempt. This wasn’t the only questionable police shooting that Toronto experienced around this time, but it was the most wanton and tragic. It prompted street demonstrations and demands for better training in deëscalation and use of force by the Toronto police.", "What good or useful lesson can be derived from Monday’s attack? Is it better or worse that the killer seems to have been motivated by some other warped ideology? Are there any credible means by which we can protect ourselves from this kind of thing? Most of what we’d wish to control is beyond our control. Often, even that which we can control we fail to control. But in the two sets of cell-phone videos, taken five years apart, there are reasons to believe that, even in an atmosphere of cynicism and mistrust, seemingly intractable dynamics can change. One can argue that the way the officer behaved on Monday was merely individual, not necessarily reflective of anything beyond himself, but to watch the two videos suggests otherwise. The differences in conduct are too stark. It may be painfully ironic that the lessons learned from the death of Sammy Yatim, who harmed no one, led to the nonviolent arrest of a person who harmed many, but it’s something to admire and embrace. It’s a lesson that shouldn’t be limited to police in the field but that should be minded by us all—in the streets, in our homes, and on our Twitter feeds."]},

By the end of the day Tuesday, it looked like he might—just might—prevent an angry showdown between the United States and Iran.\nTrump began the day by virtually declaring war on the Islamic Republic if the ", " unravels and Tehran resumes uranium enrichment, a fuel process for both peaceful nuclear energy and bombs. “They’re not going to be restarting anything,” the President pronounced angrily, during an Oval Office photo opportunity with Macron. ”If they restart it, they’re gonna have big problems, bigger than they’ve ever had before. And you can mark it down.” He called the historic accord, finalized in 2015, between Iran and the world’s six major powers, “insane. It’s ridiculous. It should never have been made.”", "But, in the afternoon, after talks with Macron, Trump was almost conciliatory. He even hinted, at a joint press conference with Macron, that the United States and its European allies could have “an agreement among ourselves very quickly. I think we’re fairly close to understanding each other.”", "The French leader is trying to coax Trump into accepting an expanded compromise that would prevent him from pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear accord—a decision is due by May 12th—and address the White House’s concerns about Iran’s broader behavior. It would build on what exists to “fix it”—the language Trump uses—rather than revise it or renegotiate it from scratch. Macron said that the “four pillars” of such a compromise would  focus on Tehran’s missile program and its meddling in the rest of the Middle East, notably in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.", "“The Iran deal is an important issue,” Macron said, during the morning photo opportunity. “But we have to take it as a part of the broader picture, which is security in the over-all region. And we have the Syrian situation. We have a common relation in Iraq. We have the stability to preserve for our allies in the region, and what we want to do is contain the Iranian presence in the region.” The Iran deal, he added, is just “part of this broader picture.”", "For Trump, the appeal of Macron’s compromise is that it produces a formal consensus among Western powers about several Middle East hot spots in which Iran is involved. It’s a burden-sharing formula at a time when Iran represents the deepest policy division between the United States and Europe. Senior European diplomats have expressed concern that a formal split on the Iran deal would undermine the transatlantic alliance, which has been the foundation of relations since the Second World War.\nTrump sees Iran’s hand—and its military—behind virtually all major problems in the world’s most volatile region, as he made clear again on Tuesday. “It just seems that no matter where you go, especially in the Middle East, Iran is behind it,” he said in his morning appearance with Macron. “You look at the ballistic missiles that they’re going and testing. What kind of a deal is it where you’re allowed to test missiles all over the place? What kind of a deal is it when you don’t talk about Yemen, and you don’t talk about all of the other problems we have with respect to Iran, especially look at what they’re doing in Iraq.”", "The compromise has its limits, however, according to European envoys. It involves an agreement between only the four Western signatories—not China and Russia, which were equal parties to the nuclear deal. It spells out how the West interprets the accord but does not formally change any of its language. For the White House, the most sensitive issue is the so-called sunset clauses—or the time when various restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program are lifted. They span from a few years to twenty-five years, although the deal, in multiple places, says Iran can never develop a nuclear bomb. One of the compromises—still being negotiated—toughens that language.", "The compromise formula faces two major hurdles: first, the Europeans are asking Washington not only to stick to the deal, brokered by the Obama Administration—they also want a pledge from the Trump Administration to fulfill the U.S. commitments under it. Iran has repeatedly charged that the United States is impeding foreign investment in Iran that was promised under the deal.", "In a full-court press, the three European powers that signed the accord—Britain, France, and Germany—are all weighing in with Trump this week to prevent him from abandoning the agreement. The German Chancellor, ", ", is due here on Friday. The British Prime Minister, ", ", is expected to have a telephone conversation with Trump this week as well.\n“The key is what they get back from the United States,” a European envoy told me. “Trying to talk to the Americans about sanctions relief for Iran has often been a one-way conversation.” But Trump suggested possible movement after his discussion with Macron on Tuesday afternoon. “I think we really had some substantive talks on Iran,” he said. “And we’re looking forward to doing something.”", "Macron struck a positive note, too. “It’s not a mystery. We did not have the same starting positions, stances, and neither you nor I have a habit of changing our stances or going with the wind,” the French leader said. “That being said, I can say that we’ve had a very frank discussion.”", "The second hurdle is getting Iran", " to accept documents that supplement the deal, which already covers a hundred and fifty-nine pages. In interviews over the weekend, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told me that Tehran is in no mood to accommodate further demands, as the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has repeatedly verified Tehran’s compliance while  the United States has violated its obligations.", "As part of the expanded compromise, Macron is also using his state visit to urge Trump to keep American forces in ", "—partly to stem Iran’s ability to widen its influence. More than two thousand U.S. troops are deployed in Syria to help defeat around two thousand residual ", " fighters. The Islamic State holds two pockets of territory in the Euphrates River Valley and along the Syrian border with Iraq. “Together, in the long run, we can find a solution to the Syrian situation,” Macron said at the press conference.", "Earlier this month, Trump declared “Mission accomplished” regarding the U.S. deployment in Syria and asked his generals to extricate American troops within four to six months. Trump seemed to have at least listened to  Macron’s appeal. “We want to come home,” the President said. “We’ll be coming home. But we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint.”", "For a man who has few friends among foreign leaders—and often ignores the advice they offer—Trump may have met a moderating influence in Macron. The President, as he has on other policy issues, may change his mind in the weeks ahead. The central question, of course, is whether he can stomach the idea of any diplomacy with Iran."]},

But the movement’s full-throated embrace of conservative politics, which began in  earnest during the early nineteen-eighties, had culminated in the 2016 Presidential election, in which eighty-one per cent of white evangelicals voted for Donald Trump.", "Many evangelical leaders, including some in attendance at Graham’s funeral, were fearful that this association with Trump now threatened the focus on personal salvation that Graham spent a lifetime preaching. After conversations with other attendees at the funeral, Doug Birdsall, the honorary chair of the Lausanne Movement, an international evangelical organization, decided to move ahead with a two-day “consultation” for evangelical leaders that he had been mulling. According to Birdsall, its aim would be to revitalize Graham’s original mission and to discuss the future of the faith.", "In the e-mail invitation Birdsall sent to participants, he wrote that the meeting was “prompted by the challenges of distortions to evangelicalism that have permeated both the media and culture since the 2016 election.” He recruited Harold Smith, the president of the Christianity Today ministry, which publishes the evangelical magazine of the same name founded by Graham, in 1956; Claude Alexander, a respected pastor in North Carolina; and Philip Ryken, the president of Wheaton College, in Illinois, to help host the gathering. Jenny Yang, a vice-president with World Relief, a refugee-resettlement group, and Gabriel Salguero, the president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, were asked to co-chair. (I was invited to attend because for several years I was the managing editor of ", ".) Like many other young Christians, the 2016 Presidential election left me with an acute sense of abandonment.", "Birdsall’s invitation stated that the “support of ‘eighty-one per cent of self-identifying white evangelicals’ for Donald Trump is a call to self-reflection on the current condition of Evangelicalism.” Nevertheless, he insisted, “Our purpose . . . is neither political nor centered on public policy.”", "Last week, more than fifty pastors, scholars, and college presidents converged on the Billy Graham Center, at Wheaton, for the meeting. Participants included the Presbyterian pastors ", " and John Ortberg, and also Mark Noll, a historian of American evangelicalism who is perhaps best known for his book “", ",” a critique of the movement’s anti-intellectual bent. Six church leaders from outside the U.S. were there to contribute their impressions on how American evangelicalism is perceived worldwide. More than half of the group was white.", "The older participants were mostly college presidents, nonprofit executives, and an assortment of pastors. The younger participants were mostly women and leaders of color. Many attendees had publicly criticized Trump before and after the election; others were concerned less with Trump and more with the way evangelicals had come to be known as a voting bloc rather than a spiritual community. If anyone in the room tacitly supported Trump, he didn’t advertise it.", "A. R. Bernard, the African-American pastor of the Christian Cultural Center, in New York, had served on Trump’s evangelical advisory council. After ", ", however, Bernard formally resigned.

Jim Wallis, the founder of Sojourners, a social-justice organization, has been a lonely voice of evangelical progressivism for forty-five years. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, was invited but did not attend.", "In early correspondence to participants, Birdsall wrote that part of the summit would be devoted to crafting a “pastoral letter,” a statement, to speak for Christians dismayed by the growing alignment with Trump. The goal was to disentangle the word “evangelical” from its current attachment with far-right partisan politics and refocus it on Christ and the Church. The statement was originally slated to be released before June, in advance of a meeting between a thousand evangelical leaders and President Trump. But, days before we arrived at Wheaton, Birdsall clarified to attendees that our gathering was not meant to be held in opposition to the June meeting. He pointed out that he had planned the event long before the one with Trump became public. Organizers seemed to be getting nervous that their efforts would be seen as partisan and anti-Trump. After two days of often tense conversations, it became clear that no statement would be released at all.", "The first afternoon session at Wheaton began on a sombre note. “This gathering is not an occasion for celebration of evangelicalism,” Mark Labberton, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, said. “This gathering emerges instead from worry, sorrow, anger, and bewilderment—whether we are Democrats or Republicans.” That so many white evangelicals supported Trump had created a “a toxic evangelicalism” that has turned “the Gospel into Good News that is fake.” He charged that U.S. evangelicalism had been complicit in violence", " against people of color over centuries, and that where denunciation was needed there had only been silence.", "Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church, in Manhattan, was another featured speaker in the afternoon. He admitted that he wasn’t entirely sure what he thought of the gathering. In his remarks, he took a more analytical approach and noted that, as the country has become more politically polarized, so has the Church, and that broader cultural narratives had co-opted the Bible.  “There’s now a red evangelicalism and a blue evangelicalism,” he said. The focus of his talk, along with that of others, was not Trump’s policies and how they affect people but the way politics have divided the Church.", "Something of a generational gap seemed to emerge among the attendees over the question of whether the Church should seek to rise above contentious political questions or address them head on. With a few exceptions, the older, white cohort stressed civility and unity. What the movement needed, they said, was a gentler evangelicalism that reached across partisan aisles for the common good. Others, especially the leaders of color, stressed repentance; there could be no real unity without white evangelicals explicitly confronting the ways in which they had participated in the degradation of persons of color and women. They contended that white evangelical churches and organizations had for decades supported a political agenda that deemed unborn lives more sacred than living black lives.", "The younger participants argued that what evangelicals need isn’t a kinder, gentler faith but a bolder one that speaks out against injustice and stands with the vulnerable. Gabriel Salguero denounced what he described as the movement’s “idolatry of safety.” He added, “We have to change our tone, yes. I submit that silence is a tone that speaks volumes.”", "All of the participants were aware that the way the proceedings were portrayed in the broader evangelical world would have consequences. Organizers initially said that some conversations over the two days would be on the record, and others would not be. But, after I tweeted quotes from several on-the-record sessions on the first day, I was asked to stop. Among the remarks I had highlighted were ones by a young black preacher from Chicago’s South Side, Charlie Dates, who said, “American evangelicalism has not been able to separate itself from the perks of white supremacy.”", "There were fewer people in attendance on the second day. Some had to get back to their churches; at least two attendees left in protest that the tone was too critical of Trump and his Christian supporters. After hearing summaries and recommendations from leaders on issues such as Islam, immigration, racism, the media, and the objectification of women, we got to the question of the statement. For more than an hour, participants stood up and, for the first time during the summit, addressed the entire group using a microphone. Several younger speakers urged that the statement had to include a tone of repentance for complicity in racism and sexism. Others in the room balked. One longtime leader of an evangelical umbrella group said that he had already received calls from donors for merely attending the meeting, and that asking them to repent for racism would be seen as too political. A few participants wondered aloud why they had come to the gathering at Wheaton in the first place.", "At the end of the second day, Birdsall and his co-chairs thanked us for coming. He said that he was hopeful that a statement would emerge in the next few days and encouraged us to continue the conversation. Exhausted, we all shuffled out of the Billy Graham Center and headed back to our own communities. Last Thursday, it was confirmed that no statement would be released. Instead, a press release was issued stating that an “honest dialogue about the current state of American evangelicalism” and its future had taken place.", "Afterward, I asked another participant, Darrell Bock, a New Testament professor and the executive director of the Center for Cultural Engagement, in Dallas, if he felt that the summit had been a success. He was sanguine about how the event had played out. “You’re there to listen to people whose voices you don’t normally get to listen to, and then on day two you’re beginning to assess what you do about it, and the reality is, we ran out of time,” he told me. Charlie Dates, the young black pastor on Chicago’s South Side, told me that he is still hopeful, because “the history of racism in American evangelicalism has been hiding in plain sight,” and now it is finally being exposed.", "Without a statement, and with the bewildering skittishness about getting political, my time at Wheaton left me feeling deeply unsettled about the moral and political fortitude of my spiritual community in the era of Trump and beyond. Much of evangelicalism still functions with a spiritual-secular divide, as if the physical concerns of this world can be neatly fixed with worship and prayer. But worship and prayer are not the only things that this Trumpian moment demands of us. Rather, the moment calls for risk. Many Christians before us—the abolitionist Charles Finney; the pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer; ", "; Desmond Tutu—stood against corruption with courage and grace. They hadn’t been afraid to get political, to challenge unjust systems and policies. The Church was made stronger for it."]},

In 1986, the leaders of the five major New York Mafia families voted on whether to kill Giuliani, who was then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and leading an aggressive push to prosecute Mob leaders. John Gotti—the most famous mafioso of his day—led the faction in favor of the motion, but Gigante cast the deciding third vote against it, and the idea was dismissed.", "It was a shrewd move by Gigante. Giuliani, in his years as a U.S. Attorney, had an impressive run prosecuting Mafia figures. This track record helped set up his successful run for New York City mayor, in 1993. But he never brought down Gigante, the biggest boss in town. Gigante was a brilliant Mafia innovator. He spent years pretending to be developmentally disabled and schizophrenic, shuffling around Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and pajamas. He relied on a “front boss,” installing Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno as the nominal head of the Genovese family while he, Gigante, retained most of the actual power, to run his organized-crime empire at a remove, discreetly issuing his orders through the ever-loyal Dominick (Quiet Dom) Cirillo. In 1986, the same year that the Five Families voted on whether to kill Giuliani, Salerno was convicted as part of the Mafia Commission Trial. Gigante remained free for another decade.", "In this way, Gigante and Giuliani were allies. They both had an interest in high-profile, tabloid-cover prosecutions of loud, famous Mob figureheads. I have to assume that Giuliani understood the arrangement. He got his heads on a pike, and Gigante stayed out of the spotlight. Gigante was finally convicted—of racketeering and conspiring to kill other mobsters—in 1997, years after Giuliani stepped down as U.S. Attorney. However discreet he had been, Gigante had, on a small handful of occasions, allowed some of the younger guys in his organization to meet with him—and that was his downfall. After decades of committing and ordering murders, and running countless illegal schemes, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison, where he died, in 2005.", "What would the Chin make of this week’s madness? What would he think of Giuliani’s oafish, ", " on television? On Sean Hannity’s Fox News program Wednesday night, Giuliani—unprompted—revealed that President Trump had lied when he said that he knew nothing about the election-season payoff that Michael Cohen, his longtime fixer, made to Stephanie Clifford, the porn actress known as Stormy Daniels. Giuliani—not heeding Hannity’s panicked warnings—went on to confirm that Cohen almost never did legal work for Trump. This undermined the argument, recently put forward by Cohen’s lawyers, that the records the government seized last month in Cohen’s office are protected by attorney-client privilege. On Thursday morning, Giuliani compounded the damage on “Fox & Friends,” where he first said that the payoff to Daniels—who claims to have had an affair with Trump, in 2006—had nothing to do with the election, before quickly contradicting himself and saying that it had everything to do with the election: an assertion that would support the argument that Trump and Cohen violated election laws.", "There are a set of requirements for any successful conspiracy. The flow of information has to be carefully controlled, by limiting all knowledge to as few people as possible, and each participant must have a well-established loyalty and a shared incentive to keep the conspiracy secret. If the conspiracy involves putting forward a false narrative—that a Mob boss is mentally ill, say, or that a President has been successful and ethical in his business dealings and has nothing to hide—then all players must be disciplined in the retelling of that narrative. (It was remarkable, in the early nineteen-nineties, to watch members of Gigante’s criminal and actual family provide rich, detailed testimony about his supposed mental incapacity; his mother and his brother—a priest and onetime New York City councilman—played particularly compelling roles.) Any minor slipup in maintaining such a fiction can be devastating. If Gigante hadn’t allowed Sammy (the Bull) Gravano to meet with him a couple of times, he might never have been caught.", "There was always a certain irony embedded in the name of the Trump Organization: there was nothing very organized about it. The company consisted of a few dozen independent actors pursuing their own self-interest but presenting money-making opportunities to the boss, Trump, as if they were all his ideas to begin with and would further his greater glory. Trump does have a few longtime aides who appear to be truly loyal, particularly Allen Weisselberg, now C.F.O. of the Trump Organization, and Matthew Calamari, Sr., who rose from security guard to C.O.O. But most of Trump’s business has been carried out by a frequently changing cast of characters. It’s striking that Michael Cohen, the man whom Trump entrusted with some of his most sensitive secrets, entered Trump’s world only about a decade ago. The President’s relationships with his other public and legal defenders, such as Giuliani, who was added to his legal team last month, are even more tenuous.", "It’s impossible to know precisely what Giuliani thought he was doing in his various television appearances this week. I suspect he believed that it would be better for Trump, legally, if the", " Stormy Daniels payoff was cast as a private matter that Trump paid out of his pocket, as having nothing to do with the election and, therefore, nothing to do with campaign-finance laws. One problem, though, was that Trump had said publicly that he knew nothing about the payoff. Aha!, Giuliani seems to have thought, we can say that Cohen’s monthly retainer from Trump was designed for just this sort of thing: to allow Cohen to take care of problems without bothering Trump with them. It would explain everything: the payoff that Trump didn’t know about but also authorized, the fact that Trump now seems to know about the payoff that he didn’t know about, and the idea that this was not a campaign-related expense. This is precisely the kind of too-clever idea that a lawyer should put to his colleagues before presenting publicly. Did Giuliani allow anyone around him to challenge the logical inconsistencies in his argument? (The Washington ", " reporter Robert Costa has ", " that Trump and Giuliani are “running” their own strategy.) How can it be that the Stormy Daniels payment has been the subject of public debate for months, and yet Trump’s defense team still hasn’t settled on how it is arranging the known facts? The reason is this: everyone around Trump sees his role as performing publicly on Trump’s behalf, to earn the big man’s fickle favor. A shared narrative, repeated with discipline, would guarantee that Trump would find the performance boring and look to someone more forceful and creative.", "This, I believe, is roughly how Giuliani found himself on national television saying words that made sense in his head but were obviously absurd when said aloud. Trump’s ", " on Thursday notwithstanding, “people of wealth” do not go around paying six-figure sums to other people who make up accusations against them. Lawyers do not “take care of problems” without letting their clients know. Huge amounts of money paid by a Presidential candidate to prevent salacious information from becoming public in the last weeks of a Presidential campaign are not independent of that campaign. These assertions are so nonsensical that even the Fox News hosts saw through them. (During Thursday’s broadcast, the “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt let out a seemingly heartfelt “I feel sorry for Melania in all of this. It’s humiliating.” Giuliani forgot to tell her that, per Trump’s own theory, there is no need to feel sorry for Melania because nothing happened, there was no affair, and her loving husband only paid the money to protect her from the embarrassment of false rumors.)", "The “Fox & Friends” interview provided perhaps the most telling moment in this whole sequence, when Giuliani responded to a tweet from Trump that laid out the very argument that Giuliani had made the night before—that the payoff was part of Cohen’s retainer. Giuliani said, “This is a tweet that’s very valuable, because the President indicates he understood it.” This was an attorney-client meeting happening on national television. Giuliani was discovering, with the cameras on, that Trump was going along with his version of events. This meant that Giuliani was, for the moment, the top dog on the team, and not in trouble with the boss, as so many imagined.", "I have found no evidence that Donald Trump ever met with or directly conducted business with Vincent (the Chin) Gigante. But Trump is widely believed to have struck a deal with Gigante’s front, Fat Tony, in the late nineteen-seventies and early eighties. In exchange for allowances from the Mob-controlled construction unions, Trump is supposed to have overpaid for concrete from a company that Fat Tony partly owned and officially controlled. Gigante, of course, would have stayed far away from someone like Trump. He is exactly the kind of undisciplined loudmouth who always gets himself and everyone around him in trouble. He can’t keep a loyal cadre; he can’t construct a durable, credible narrative. He’s such obvious bad news that only the desperate will go near him."]},

Good Magic’s trainer is the hard-charging, thirty-nine-year-old wunderkind Chad Brown, from Mechanicville in upstate New York, who is hungry for his first Derby win, and may very well get it. As of Friday morning, the odds were twelve to one—an excellent bet.", "Irad, who is eighteen months older than Jose, is in the nine hole, aboard another colt, named Hofburg, trained by the South Dakota-born Bill Mott, who, at sixty-four, is still looking for his first Derby win. The horse is something of an unknown, but Mott, a popular figure at Churchill Downs, says that he’s never had a better chance.", "The three-to-one favorite in the race is Justify, a Bob Baffert-trained three-year-old, ridden by Mike Smith, who is twenty-eight years older than Jose. (In perhaps no other sport, aside from golf, do the top competitors in a premier event range so disparately in age.) Justify will be in the seventh hole, between the two Ortizes. (Lone Sailor, a fifty-to-one shot, is in the eight hole.) Justify, who trains in California, has an extraordinary physique, but his track record is slender; he has only been racing since January, and his favored status is mainly based on his last race: the April 7th Santa Anita Derby, in which he blew the field away, showing great power and form in the final eighth mile. If Justify picks up where he left off that day, the horse will be hard to beat.", "Other contenders in the race include, in fourteen, the European champion, Mendelssohn (so fancy!), who won the United Arab Emirates Derby by eighteen and a half lengths, and Magnum Moon, in sixteen, one of four horses in the race trained by the Texan Todd Pletcher. Audible, in the five hole on Jose’s left flank, is also a contender, as is Vino Rosso in eighteen, ridden by the Hall of Famer Johnny Velazquez, the leader of the New York jockey colony.

Irad, never to be outdone for long by his little brother, is leading all jockeys in wins so far in 2018.", "Handicappers generally don’t rate the jockeys in their published predictions. The rule in any race is that the winner will be eighty per cent horse and twenty per cent jockey, so you’re better off betting on the horses than on the men (and, once again, the jockeys in the Derby are all men).", "But the reason that the Kentucky Derby is difficult to handicap is that in addition to the unusual size of the field—twenty, which is two or three times as many entrants in a workaday race—none of the mostly very young horses in the field have ever experienced anything like a hundred thousand people, some well lit, singing “My Old Kentucky Home” at the top of their lubricated lungs. An untested horse might freak out. Last year, Thunder Snow, one of the horses in the field, refused to run when the gates opened, and instead tried to buck his jockey off.", "The advantage under these circumstances goes to the jockeys who possess the ineffable quality that is called “horsemanship.” It is a deep love of horses that flows from riders to animals in moments of potentially energy-sapping panic, and settles them. During my reporting, I heard trainers say again and again that Jose in particular possesses this quality of horsemanship, to a degree that they had never seen before. Mike Smith, who rides in California, no doubt has it, too, and Smith, who is known as Big Money Mike, has won five Triple Crown races, whereas the Ortizes have still only won one each, at Belmont, their home track.", "But Smith will have to contend with the pair of them—an Ortiz on each flank. Someone is going to have to go out and challenge Justify early, because that hasn’t happened before in his three victories (in three races). That challenger may cause Justify to burn energy early, and that would give a chance to a trailing horse conserving energy back in the pack. Irad is well placed to be that challenger, and he would hope to keep enough of his horse’s energy in reserve to outlast others in the final stretch. But this strategy would also open the door for his brother, Jose, who is riding a horse he already knows very well, and who may be the best closer in racing.

On the one hand, they remain, on their best nights, the best example of what the N.B.A. can offer in the way of perfection. The byword of the star forward Kevin Durant’s game is efficiency. Despite his sheer limb length—which often, even within the context of wingspan-dependent basketball, seems somewhat overdone—each of his moves is irreducibly concise, almost modest. A jab step, then a dribble, then a shot: the score scrolls upward before you’ve gotten a chance to identify whom he’s exploited, or how. Watching Durant is like listening to certain rappers of an older generation—somebody like Q-Tip comes to mind—for whom a deep, preconscious love of his chosen medium, and of the culture that surrounds it, has been transformed into a smooth mastery. Then there’s the ball-handling big man Draymond Green, who seems to see each possible angle as he rushes the ball downcourt on a fast break, or holds it near the foul line, deciding whether to shoot it or slip it over to the corner, where a teammate has a better shot. Green is the team’s thick-bellied engine, blowing just enough smoke to dramatize the effort it takes to keep chugging. The shooting guard Klay Thompson, meanwhile, brings basketball down to the level of simple math. He makes nearly as many shots as he misses, thanks to a form that belongs in some future Museum of Motion. When he’s really feeling it, he turns whole quarters into shooting contests against himself.", "But the Warriors have also seemed, for almost the entirety of this past regular season, to be laboring under a kind of malaise. None of the talents of the aforementioned stars has diminished, but they have nonetheless fallen short of their ", ". It’s understandable: they’ve been to the N.B.A. Finals three times in a row; there must be some serious fatigue, and even distraction, in their locker room.

But his real gift—which, by synecdoche, has become the real soul of the team—is the sense of giddy, carnivalesque fun that he brings to the game. On Tuesday night, on the way to five three-pointers and twenty-eight points in twenty-seven minutes, he shot from crazy distances, often hot-dogging or holding his follow-through for an extra few seconds. At one point he stood there, shooting wrist frozen, as in imitation of a hook-necked swan, one knee in front of the other, face stuck slyly in an indication of glee. Rodin might have made something of a pose like this.", "When the Warriors are at their best, they play with a passion that verges on irresponsibility; they seem to be using basketball more as a means of expression than as a ground for combat. In this mode, they fling passes like smooth stones into a pond—not all of them skip exactly as intended, but the fun is in the throwing. There are turnovers (often lots of them) and sometimes even totally sloppy, self-destructive play. But their potential for greatness inches upward, too. On nights like Tuesday, when they won 121–116, and seemed ready to sweep the Pelicans, a paradox clarifies itself: the Warriors’ road to greatness runs through happy imperfection.", "For the Toronto Raptors, who, on Thursday, lost a devastating second game to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, imperfection has been less happy. It has become a joke over the past few years that James owns the Raptors, given the way his Cavs have blocked Toronto’s way in the playoffs, beating them in series after series. But things are supposed to be different this time around: the Raptors tweaked and modernized their approach, shooting more three-pointers, playing more swiftly, and handing over control of their offense more wholly to the guard DeMar DeRozan, who has enjoyed the best season of his career.", "But James, smashing any hoped-for strategy, has been a marvel—even more so than usual. Thursday’s fourth quarter was an incredible show. For ", ", it was a kind of psychological torture. James hit impossible fade-away jumpers in showy clusters, not unlike Curry’s threes against the Pelicans. On a few occasions, his body rested in the air in what looked like a forty-five-degree angle. Then he tossed up his shots in high, almost comical rainbows. When they floated through the hoop, the Raptors’ fans grew increasingly quiet, and the players looked ready to wander off the court, into the nearest airport security line, and away from Canada for good. James was amazing, but his opponents were commensurately stricken. They never seemed to have a chance, or even to believe that they might.", "The sight recalled another team I’ve been watching lately.

A few weeks ago, the coach was watching from the sidelines, hands on haunches, as his team practiced inbounding plays.

The cure, he said, and in the moment I believed him, was to eliminate them in the real world, through a kind of sports-therapeutic Method acting: Strasberg for shooters. “You need to practice feeling good about yourself!” he said.", "I try to resist sports clichés about toughness and fortitude, “killer instinct” and singleness of mind.

Last month, when the ", " and this magazine were awarded a joint Pulitzer Prize for coverage of sexual harassment, Schneiderman issued a congratulatory tweet, praising “the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they had endured at the hands of powerful men.” Without these women, he noted, “there would not be the critical national reckoning under way.”", "Now Schneiderman is facing a reckoning of his own. As his prominence as a voice against sexual misconduct has risen, so, too, has the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters. They accuse Schneiderman of having subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. All have been reluctant to speak out, fearing reprisal. But two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, have talked to ", " on the record, because they feel that doing so could protect other women. They allege that he repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam categorize the abuse he inflicted on them as “assault.” They did not report their allegations to the police at the time, but both say that they eventually sought medical attention after having been slapped hard across the ear and face, and also choked. Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and her phones tapped, and both say that he threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he “never made any of these threats.”)", "A third former romantic partner of Schneiderman’s told Manning Barish and Selvaratnam that he also repeatedly subjected her to nonconsensual physical violence, but she told them that she is too frightened of him to come forward. (", " ", " has independently vetted the accounts that they gave of her allegations.) A fourth woman, an attorney who has held prominent positions in the New York legal community, says that Schneiderman made an advance toward her; when she rebuffed him, he slapped her across the face with such force that it left a mark that lingered the next day. She recalls screaming in surprise and pain, and beginning to cry, and says that she felt frightened.  She has asked to remain unidentified, but shared a photograph of the injury with ", ".", "In a statement, Schneiderman said, “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”", "Manning Barish was romantically involved with Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until New Year’s Day in 2015. Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017. Both are articulate, progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan. They work and socialize in different circles, and although they have become aware of each other’s stories, they have only a few overlapping acquaintances; to this day, they have never spoken to each other. Over the past year, both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct. But, as Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the ", ", their anguish and anger grew.", "In February, four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke, Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him. At a press conference, he denounced Weinstein, saying, “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here.” On May 2nd, at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., and the New York City Police Department. (In 2015, Vance declined to bring criminal charges against Weinstein, saying that he lacked sufficient evidence—a decision criticized by activist groups.) In a speech, Cuomo explained that “sexual-assault complaints must be pursued aggressively, and to the fullest extent of the law.” The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history.", "Schneiderman’s activism on behalf of feminist causes has increasingly won him praise from women’s groups. On May 1st, the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health honored him as one of three “Champions of Choice” at its annual fund-raising luncheon. Accepting the award, Schneiderman said, “If a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.” But, as Manning Barish sees it, “you cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them", " and choking them in bed, and saying to them, ‘You’re a fucking whore.’ ” She says of Schneiderman’s involvement in the Weinstein investigation, “How can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country’s most important sexual-assault case?” Selvaratnam describes Schneiderman as “a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” figure, and says that seeing him lauded as a supporter of women has made her “feel sick,” adding, “This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly. But he abuses them privately. He needs to be called out.”", "Manning Barish notes that many of her friends attended the N.I.R.H. luncheon. “His hypocrisy is epic,” she says. “He’s fooled so many people.” Manning Barish includes herself among them. She says that she met Schneiderman in July, 2013, through mutual friends. She had become a blogger and political activist after opposing her younger brother’s deployment to Iraq and working with groups such as MoveOn.org. Amicably divorced from Chris Barish, a hospitality-industry executive, she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends. Schneiderman, who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general, in 2010, was also divorced. His ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker, currently serves as one of his political consultants. They have a grown daughter.", "Manning Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness. Page Six chronicled the romance, calling her a “ravishing redhead” and noting that, at a fund-raiser, the television producer Norman Lear had introduced her as Schneiderman’s “bride-to-be.”", "But Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior. Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn’t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician. The process of having it removed was painful and expensive. In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body. “Taking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces is his jam,” she says.", "About four weeks after they became physically involved, she says, Schneiderman grew violent. One night, they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment, still clothed but getting ready for bed, and lightly baiting each other. As she recalls it, he called her “a whore,” and she talked back. They had both been drinking, and her recollection of their conversation is blurry, but what happened next remains vivid. Schneiderman, she says, backed her up to the edge of his bed. “All of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly onto my ear,” Manning Barish says. “It was horrendous. It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”", "She finally freed herself and got back on her feet. “I was crying and in shock,” she says. She recalls shouting, “Are you crazy?” To her astonishment, Schneiderman accused her of scratching him. At one point—she can’t remember if it was at this moment or in a later conversation—he told her, “You know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.”", "After the incident, Manning Barish left the apartment, telling him that she would never come back. “I want to make it absolutely clear,” she says. “This was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong. This did not happen while we were having sex. I was fully dressed and remained that way. It was completely unexpected and shocking. I did not consent to physical assault.”", "In the following days, Manning Barish confided to three close female friends that Schneiderman had hit her. All of them have confirmed this to ", " “She was distraught,” one of the friends, a high-profile media figure, says. “She was very, very upset. This wasn’t a gentle smack. He clocked her ear. I was shocked.” She notes, “Michelle had mentioned that he drank a lot, and that he changed under the influence of alcohol, but I’d never anticipated that he would be violent.” The friend describes Manning Barish as having seemed “sad” and “torn,” because “she’d really wanted the relationship to work.”", "The novelist Salman Rushdie, who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did, and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years, says that she confided in him as well. “She called me and told me he had hit her,” Rushdie recalls. “She was obviously very upset. I was horrified.” In his view, Schneiderman’s behavior does not fall into the kind of gray area that should remain private. “It was clear to me that it crossed a line,” he says. Rushdie, who describes Manning Barish as “a very truthful person, in my experience,” advised her to stay away from Schneiderman.", "But", " Manning Barish went back to him, a decision that she regrets. After the attack, she says, Schneiderman “called and called” her. A few days later, on a weekday afternoon, his security detail drove him to her apartment, and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine. She found the wine surprising, given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior. She recalls saying over and over, “You hit me! You hurt me! You should never hit a woman!” But he didn’t want to talk about having hit her. “The hitting was ", " an issue for him,” she says. Before long, they reconciled.", "Manning Barish says that her ear bothered her for months. It often felt painful and clogged, and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds. Once, blood trickled out, reaching her collarbone. Eventually, Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr. Gwen Korovin, an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Manning Barish shared her medical records with ", ". They confirm that, on September 13, 2014, Korovin found and removed “dried bloody crust” from Manning Barish’s ear. Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury, but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip. “I was protecting Eric,” Manning Barish says. “And I was ashamed. For victims, shame plays a huge role in most of these stories. I want people to know that.” Korovin was asked by ", " if the injury could have been caused by a slap. “Yes, it could be consistent with a slap,” she said. “You could perforate an eardrum in a lot of ways, with a Q-tip or with a slap.”", "Manning Barish and Schneiderman were together, off and on, for nearly two years. She says that when they had sex he often slapped her across the face without her consent, and that she felt “emotionally battered” by cruel remarks that he made. She says that he criticized how she looked and dressed, and “controlled what I ate.” Manning Barish, who is five feet seven, lost thirty pounds, falling to a hundred and three. In a photograph from the period, she looks emaciated; her hair, she recalls, started to fall out. Nevertheless, he squeezed her legs and called them “chubby.”", "Manning Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol. She recalls, “I would come over for dinner. An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter. He had had a head start. ‘Very stressful day,’ he would say.” Sometimes, if she didn’t drink quickly enough, she says, he would “come to me like a baby who wouldn’t eat its food, and hold the glass to my lips while holding my face, and sweetly but forcefully, like a parent, say, ‘Come on, Mimi, drink, drink, drink,’ and essentially force me—at times actually spilling it down my chin and onto my chest.” Schneiderman, she recalls, “would almost always drink two bottles of wine in a night, then bring a bottle of Scotch into the bedroom. He would get absolutely plastered five nights out of seven.” On one occasion, she recalls, “he literally fell on his face in my kitchen, straight down, like a tree falling.” Another evening, he smashed his leg against an open drawer, cutting it so badly that “there was blood all over the place.” She bandaged it, but the next day she went to his office to change the dressing, because the bleeding hadn’t stopped.", "Manning Barish says that Schneiderman also took prescription tranquillizers, and often asked her to refill a prescription that she had for Xanax, so that he could reserve “about half” the pills for himself. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he has “never commandeered anyone’s medications.”) Sometimes in bed, she recalls, he would be “shaking me and grabbing my face” while demanding that she repeat such things as “I’m a little whore.” She says that he also told her, “If you ever left me, I’d kill you.”", "Evan Stark, a forensic social worker and an emeritus professor at Rutgers, is the author of a landmark book, “Coercive Control,” in which he argues that domestic abuse is just as often psychological as it is physical. Abusive men, he writes, often “terrorize” and “control” their partners by demeaning them, particularly about the traits or accomplishments of which they are proudest. Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism. When she told him of her plan to attend an anti-gun demonstration with various political figures and a group of parents from Sandy Hook Elementary School, he dismissed the effort, calling the demonstrators “losers.” He added, “Go ahead, if it makes you feel better to do your little political things.” When she was using her computer, he’d sometimes say, “Oh, look at little Mimi. So cute—she’s ", "” He told Manning Barish that, because she had childcare, she wasn’t “a real single mother.”", "Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time, and then got back together with him. He’d been talking about marrying her, she says, and she somehow convinced herself that the real problem between them was her fear of commitment. In January, 2015, she ended the relationship a third time, feeling degraded. After that, they got together romantically a few more times, but since 2016 she has been in touch with him only", " sporadically.", "Since the #MeToo movement began, Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms, cheering on women who have spoken out, including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator ", ", a widely admired Democrat. Once, she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media, in connection with a political issue. He called her and, in a tone that she describes as “nasty,” said, “Don’t ever write about me. You don’t want to do that.” Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat, just as she took seriously a comment that he’d once made after she objected to him “yanking” her across a street. She recalls saying to him, “Jaywalking is against the law,” and him responding, “I ", " the law.” Manning Barish says, “If there is a sentence that sums him up, it’s that.”", "Schneiderman was elected to the New York State Senate in 1998, and served for twelve years. He wrote many laws, including one that created specific penalties for strangulation. He introduced the bill in 2010, after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat, who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend. During the hearings, the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking, even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides. Not only did Schneiderman’s bill make life-threatening strangulation a grave crime; it also criminalized less serious cases involving “an intent to impede breathing” as misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison. “I’m just sorry it took us so long in New York State to do this,” Schneiderman declared at the time. “I think this will save a lot of lives.”", "Jennifer Friedman, a legal expert on domestic violence, says that she cannot square Schneiderman’s public and private behavior. Anyone knowledgeable about intimate-partner violence, she says, knows that choking is “a known lethality indicator.” She adds, “I cannot fathom that someone who ", " the legislation on strangulation is unfamiliar with such concepts.” She also says, “A slap is not just a slap—it reverberates through the rest of the relationship, making her afraid of setting him off.” She adds, “People aren’t usually prosecuted for it, but, in the state of New York, slapping ", " assault when it results in pain or physical injury.”", "In the summer of 2016, the attorney general may have crossed this line again. He went to a party in the Hamptons, where he drank heavily, and invited another guest—a woman he’d known for some time—to join him at an after-party. An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience, she had worked closely with his office in the past, and supported him politically. She says that she agreed to let a man in Schneiderman’s security detail drive them to the next destination. But, when they arrived at the house, there was no party; it was where Schneiderman was staying. The security officer left the property.", "The lawyer and Schneiderman began making out, but he said things that repelled her. He told the woman, a divorced mother, that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that, when it came to sex, they secretly wanted men to take charge. She recalls him saying, “Yeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut. You want to be my whore.” He became more sexually aggressive, but she was repulsed by his talk, and pulled away from him. She says that “suddenly—at least, in my mind’s eye—he drew back, and there was a moment where I was, like, ‘What’s happening?’ ” Then, she recalls, “He slapped me across the face hard, twice,” adding, “I was stunned.”", "Schneiderman hit her so hard, she says, that the blow left a red handprint. “What the fuck did you just do?” she screamed, and started to sob. “I couldn’t believe it,” she recalls. “For a split second, I was scared.” She notes that, in all her years of dating, she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman. “He just really ", " me,” she says.", "When she told him that she wanted to leave, she recalls, he started to “freak out,” saying that he’d misjudged her. “You’d really be surprised,” he claimed. “A lot of women like it. They don’t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.” She again demanded to be taken home. They got into his car, and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was. As he drove, weaving along back roads, she was terrified that he’d kill not just her but another driver. She says that Schneiderman “broke the law at ", " once that night.” (“This is untrue,” Schneiderman’s spokesperson said.)", "The next day, she told two friends, and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face. (Both women corroborate this.) Another photograph of the lawyer, taken later that day at a family birthday party, shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek. One of the friends says of Schneiderman, “He seemed not to know what the word ‘consent’ means.”", "Given the woman’s prominence in the legal sphere, Schneiderman’s actions had exposed him to tremendous risk. Yet she took no official action against him. “Now", " that I know it’s part of a pattern, I think, God, I should have reported it,” she says. “But, back then, I believed that it was a one-time incident. And I thought, He’s a good attorney general, he’s doing good things. I didn’t want to jeopardize that.” She notes that he did not hit her again, after she protested. Nevertheless, she says of the assault, “I knew it was wrong,” adding, “Our top law officer, this guy with a platform for women’s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for.”", "Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of “The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,” which explores infertility issues; she is also an actor and a film producer, as well as a supporter of feminist and progressive social causes. She, too, is divorced. In 2016, she attended the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia, where Schneiderman introduced himself to her. She says that their first encounter felt “like kismet.” They had both gone to Harvard: she as an undergraduate and a graduate student, he as a law student. She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism. They had both studied Chinese, and, when he asked, in Mandarin, if she spoke the language, she answered, “", "”—“Yes, but not fluently.”", "They began dating, and appeared to be a happy couple. Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment, attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors, and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects. But, as she puts it, “it was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.” Although Schneiderman often doted on her, he demanded that she spend more and more time with him, and he began physically abusing her in bed. “The slaps started after we’d gotten to know each other,” she recalls. “It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder.” Selvaratnam says, “It wasn’t consensual. This wasn’t sexual playacting. This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.”", "When Schneiderman was violent, he often made sexual demands. “He was obsessed with having a threesome, and said it was my job to find a woman,” she says. “He said he’d have nothing to look forward to if I didn’t, and would hit me until I agreed.” (She had no intention of having a threesome.) She recalls, “Sometimes, he’d tell me to call him Master, and he’d slap me until I did.” Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, has dark skin, and she recalls that “he started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’ ”", "The abuse escalated. Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her. “He was cutting off my ability to breathe,” she says. Eventually, she says, “we could rarely have sex without him beating me.” In her view, Schneiderman “is a misogynist and a sexual sadist.” She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her, and tried to push him away. At other times, she gave in, rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex. But “the emotional and verbal abuse started increasing,” she says, and “the belittling and demeaning of me carried over into our nonsexual encounters.” He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors. He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes. He mocked some of her friends as “ditzes,” and, when these women attended a birthday celebration for her, he demanded that she leave just as the cake was arriving. “I began to feel like I was in Hell,” she says.", "Like Manning Barish, Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman routinely drank heavily—a bottle and a half of wine, or more. He also took sedatives, she says, and pushed her to drink with him, saying, “Drink your bourbon, Turnip”—his nickname for her. In the middle of the night, he staggered through the apartment, as if in a trance. “I’ve never seen anyone that messed up,” she recalls. “It was like sleeping next to a monster.” The next morning, she says, he’d seem fine, but often berated her for not having kept him away from the alcohol. His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election. He had counted on forging an ambitious partnership with a White House led by ", ". Instead, the Presidency had gone to ", ". Earlier, Schneiderman’s office had sued Trump University for civil fraud, and Trump had countersued Schneiderman personally.", "On the morning of January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s Inauguration, Schneiderman called Selvaratnam from a hospital emergency room. She recalls, “He told me that he’d been drinking the night before he fell down. He didn’t realize he’d cut himself, and got into bed, and when he woke up he was in a pool of blood.” Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital. Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye; his face was puffy and bruised. He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury, and they agreed to cancel a public appearance. In the image, which was shared with", " ", ", Schneiderman has a black eye and a bandage across the left side of his forehead. Schneiderman then called Cunningham, his ex-wife and political consultant, and they agreed that he and Selvaratnam should tell anyone who asked about the injury that he had fallen “while running.” (A spokesperson for Schneiderman said, “One morning, Mr. Schneiderman fell in the bathroom while completely sober, hit his head, and had to go the E.R. for stitches. Because he was embarrassed to tell his staff he fell in the bathroom, he told them he fell while running.” Cunningham, in a statement issued shortly after this story was published online, said, “I’ve known Eric for nearly thirty-five years as a husband, father, and friend. These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values, and a loving father. I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.”)", "Selvaratnam understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year. But, she says, “now I see how independent women get stuck in one.” The physical abuse, she notes, “happens quickly”: “He’s drunk, and you’re naked and at your most vulnerable. It’s so disorienting. You lose a little of who you are.” She kept telling herself that she could help him change, and tried to get him to see a therapist. At times, she blamed herself for his behavior. “I was scared what he might do if I left him,” she says. “He had said he would have to kill me if we broke up, on multiple occasions. He also told me he could have me followed and could tap my phone.”", "It’s unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks, but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated. Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations. She says, “It’s often true that women don’t know whether to take threats to kill seriously. But we should ", " take threats seriously. It’s categorized as a violent act, and you can report someone to the police for it.”", "Selvaratnam began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman, and last fall she ended the relationship. She’d been suffering from ringing in her ears, and sometimes had vertigo. After the breakup, she, like Manning Barish, sought medical help from an ear, nose, and throat specialist. The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments. The writer Danzy Senna, a close friend of Selvaratnam’s, recalls, “She was thin, fragile, and shaky.” Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse, and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband, so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend. Senna’s document, which she shared with ", " ", ", is dated September 16, 2017, and says, in part, “She told me that her boyfriend of a year, Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, has been choking, beating, and threatening her for the entirety of their relationship, and that several times he threatened to have her killed if she ever tried to leave him. She said he knows that she has a lot of really damning information about him, his alcoholism, sexual deviance, and drug use, and she worries about her safety.”", "Senna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment. On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend—Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine. As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn’t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman. Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated. Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend—not Manning Barish—and described where she had worked.", "The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend. Gonnerman asked him if he’d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman. He said yes: a close friend of his had. Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, “So how did that work out?” He answered, “He used to spit on her and slap her during sex.”", "Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim. “She was very traumatized,” Gonnerman recalls. “On the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, ‘Why hasn’t anyone stopped him?’ ”", "Selvaratnam says, “I wished someone had warned me. And I wondered, Who’s next?” She notes, “I was not planning to come forward, until I found out there was another woman. The silence of women before me meant that I’d suffered, too. I felt, I will not be able to live with myself if I hear of him doing this to another woman years or months from now.”", "Selvaratnam reached out to the former girlfriend, and they agreed to meet. In February, Selvaratnam recalls, they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes, and their stories came flooding forth. Selvaratnam says that she was astounded to discover how similar their experiences had been.", "Selvaratnam kept notes about her exchanges with the former girlfriend, and she described them to ", " ", ". According to these notes, the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been", " in love with Schneiderman, but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face, as tears rolled down her cheeks. He also choked her and spat at her. Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context. She said that Schneiderman had once slapped her during an argument they’d had while getting dressed to go out. The blow left a handprint on her back; the next day, the spot still hurt. When the former girlfriend objected to this mistreatment, he told her that she simply wasn’t “liberated” enough. Just as Schneiderman had done with the other women, he had pushed her to drink with him and to set up a threesome, and he had belittled her work and appearance, saying in her case that she had fat legs and needed Botox.", "After the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose. She described this response as heartbreaking. And when Schneiderman heard that she had turned against him, she said, he warned her that politics was a tough and personal business, and that she’d better be careful. She told Selvaratnam that she had taken this as a threat.", "The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she found it “shameless” that Schneiderman was casting himself as a leading supporter of the #MeToo movement. She promised to support Selvaratnam if she spoke out, but she wasn’t sure that she could risk joining her. The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she’d once been so afraid of Schneiderman that she’d written down an extensive account of the abuse, locked the document in a safe-deposit box, and given keys to two friends.", "In February, the news broke that Rob Porter, a top aide in the Trump White House, was resigning, amid allegations that he’d abused his two ex-wives. One of the women, Colbie Holderness, released a photograph of herself taken after he’d allegedly given her a black eye. The image resonated deeply among the women who had dated Schneiderman. Manning Barish recalls, “After Rob Porter, I was struggling about whether to come forward. I felt guilt and shame that I was encouraging other women to speak out but wasn’t doing the same. I was a hypocrite. I was in tears.” Her friends told her that she risked becoming known mainly for being Schneiderman’s victim, and  she initially agreed to let the matter go. But, after thinking it over, she told them, “If he’s done this to more than one woman, I’m going to say something.”", "After Porter’s resignation, Selvaratnam felt more determined than ever to speak out about Schneiderman and the broader issue of intimate-partner violence. As this story was being reported, Manning Barish became aware that there were other victims, and decided that she had three choices: “I can lie. I can be silent, which is being complicit, and a betrayal of the other women. Or I can tell the truth.” She concluded, “I’m choosing No. 3.” Manning Barish is aware of the risks faced by women who take on powerful politicians, and isn’t relishing the prospect of taking on the attorney general. “It’s hard,” she says. “It affects your life, and not in a positive way.”", "Selvaratnam says that she considered filing an ethics complaint against Schneiderman, or bringing a civil suit, but the various legal options she considered were always connected to Schneiderman in some way. Meanwhile, at least eight members of Congress had resigned, or announced plans to retire, after being accused of sexual misconduct. In Missouri, the legislature called a special session to take up the impeachment of Governor Eric Greitens, who had been accused of slapping, restraining, and belittling a woman during an affair. Greitens has denied the allegations, but he is facing a felony charge stemming from the woman’s assertion that he took compromising photographs of her, in an effort to stop her from speaking out.", "Selvaratnam, by contrast, feels caught up in circumstances that have given her only one real choice: to go public. “It’s torturous for me to do this,” she says. “I like my life.” Of this article, she says, “I wish my name did not have to be in it,” and notes, of Schneiderman, “I know it’s going to be my word against his, because I don’t have photos of bruises, and I don’t have a police report.” Schneiderman’s accusers, she feels, are in an unusually difficult situation. As she puts it, “What do you do if your abuser is the top law-enforcement official in the state?”"]},
